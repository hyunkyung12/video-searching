1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,100
They make movies about all kinds of things
these days.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,160
From superheroes saving the universe and women
of color using math to win the space race,

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,179
to the brutal horror of something like The
Human Centipede.

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,179
Ew.

5
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:16,820
But there are some topics that filmmakers
shy away from, even today.

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:22,220
While movies can take bold stands on controversial
issues, they usually root stories in safer territory.

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,660
In fact, back in the 1910s in the heart of
Hollywood, a director named Lois Weber found

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,439
a lot of success making films about the most
pressing social issues of her time.

9
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:34,970
And one of her signature films is a drama
from 1916 that took on one of the most contentious

10
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,320
subjects in American life: abortion.

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:50,660
[intro music plays]

12
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,610
Lois Weber was kind of an anomaly in the early

13
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:53,789
days of Hollywood.

14
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,649
She was an extremely successful filmmaker
in an industry that’s dominated by men.

15
00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:02,960
Weber began her film career in the transitional
period of cinema history, around 1907 to 1913,

16
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,120
when mainstream movies started to look like
movies today.

17
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,120
They were feature-length fictional narratives,
told with traditional film grammar, and supported

18
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,300
by a star system.

19
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,330
A big name associated with the time is D.W. Griffith,

20
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:17,480
who used sophisticated tools of
film grammar – things like close-ups, cross-cutting,

21
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,600
and subtle performances – to involve audiences
in the emotions of his characters.

22
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:26,320
Collaborating with her husband Phillips Smalley,
Lois Weber made a series of wildly successful

23
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,470
films that also experimented with film grammar
to engage people.

24
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:33,410
She pioneered some unusual techniques, from
split screens to superimpositions.

25
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:37,170
She was one of the first filmmakers to experiment
with synchronous sound.

26
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,540
And she was the first female director to own
her own film studio.

27
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,520
Not only that, but all of her early films
tackled hot button issues more directly than

28
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,470
the work of most of her peers.

29
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:50,970
With titles like Shoes, The People vs. John
Doe, and The Devil’s Brew, she took on subjects

30
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,940
like child labor, capital punishment, and
temperance.

31
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,210
In 1917, she made a film called Is a Woman
a Person?

32
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,180
– released as The Hand the Rocks the Cradle.

33
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,640
It was about Margaret Sanger’s real-life
arrest for spreading information about birth control.

34
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,180
Weber was quoted at the time saying, “My
close study of the editorial page has taught

35
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,169
me that … its effect is far reaching upon
thousands of readers.

36
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,989
I feel that, like them, I can … also deliver
a message to the world … that will receive

37
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:17,879
a ready and cheerful response from the better
element of the big general public.”

38
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:21,890
One reason she was able to grapple with these
social issues so directly is that she was

39
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,540
making her films before 1930.

40
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,490
That’s when Hollywood instituted the Motion
Picture Production Code, also known as the

41
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:32,430
Hays Code, which we covered in Crash Course
Film History with Craig.

42
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,620
Besides prohibiting things like nudity, sex,
violence, and drug use, the Hays Code said

43
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,069
that films couldn’t directly address controversial
issues.

44
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:43,120
Filmmakers had to rely on subtext and innuendo
instead.

45
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,639
So Lois Weber’s films can be kind of startling
for us to watch nowadays.

46
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:50,010
We’re used to old, black-and-white movies
feeling restrained or stuffy – not confronting

47
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,549
social issues that are still relevant even
today.

48
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:55,920
And one of the best examples of her work comes
from 1916.

49
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,989
Where Are My Children dives straight into
the controversial topic of abortion.

50
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:03,620
The film combines Weber’s sophisticated
grasp of cinema, her deep desire to explore

51
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,319
social issues, and her sometimes flawed point
of view.

52
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,159
There are a couple ways to dissect Where Are
My Children, and first we’re going to look

53
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:13,230
at it through a historical lens – in terms
of social issues as well as filmic techniques.

54
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,819
Where Are My Children tells the story of a
District Attorney named Richard Walton, played

55
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:21,299
by the imposing Tyrone Power, Sr., and his
wife, known only as Mrs. Walton, played by

56
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:22,299
Helen Riaume.

57
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:26,189
The couple is childless, and the film goes
to great lengths to show how much Mr. Walton

58
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:27,569
wants kids.

59
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:32,200
We see him looking wistful, enjoying the neighborhood
children, and fawning over his sister’s baby.

60
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,579
Mrs. Walton, we discover, would rather play
with her puppy and hang out with other high

61
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:37,609
society women than raise children.

62
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:41,260
When one of Mrs. Walton’s friends confides
in her that she’s pregnant, Mrs. Walton

63
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,530
brings her to Dr. Malfit, a physician who
has performed abortions for Mrs. Walton and

64
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,819
many of her friends.

65
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:47,819
Also…

66
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:49,290
Dr. Malfit?

67
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,150
Coulda just named him Dr. Bad Guy or Dr. Evil.

68
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,150
But, whatever...

69
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,749
As the film progresses, Mrs. Walton has a
change of heart and decides that she is

70
00:03:56,749 --> 00:03:58,010
ready to start a family.

71
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:02,470
And then, we’re told that her history of
abortions has left her unable to bear children.

72
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:06,159
Meanwhile, her lecherous brother comes to
visit and seduces her housekeeper’s young

73
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,150
daughter, leaving her pregnant.

74
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,639
The young woman seeks help from Mrs. Walton,
who sends the girl to Dr. Malfit.

75
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:15,019
This time, the procedure goes badly and the
young woman dies.

76
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:20,180
Enraged, Mr. Walton attacks his brother-in-law
and prosecutes Dr. Malfit, who is sentenced

77
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,089
to fifteen years hard labor.

78
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:26,740
Before the doctor is taken away, he warns
Mr. Walton to examine his own family before

79
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,139
he starts casting blame.

80
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:33,660
In the doctor’s ledger, Mr. Walton discovers
his wife’s name, along with many of her friends.

81
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,080
He confronts them and accuses his wife of
murder.

82
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:40,009
In the film’s final moments, we see the
Waltons sitting by the fire, visited by the

83
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:42,139
spirits of the children they never had.

84
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:47,039
It’s a remarkable effect that keeps unfolding,
as the Waltons grow old before our eyes and

85
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:51,150
their now-grown children fade into and out
of the shot one last time.

86
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,720
Not exactly a happy ending!

87
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,629
Now, this film grapples with tough ideas like
reproductive rights, which isn’t an easy

88
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,870
conversation to have.

89
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:01,889
But if you look closely at what the movie’s
trying to say, what at first seems like

90
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:05,319
a progressive stance ends up being a bit self-contradictory.

91
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:10,030
Early in the film, Mr. Walton somewhat reluctantly
prosecutes a man for distributing pro-birth-control

92
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,419
literature, which at the time was illegal.

93
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:15,990
During the man’s testimony, we flash back
to his work with the poor, their homes full

94
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,460
of disease, domestic abuse, and even suicide.

95
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,100
The defendant argues that if these women had
access to birth control, there would be less

96
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,360
suffering in their communities.

97
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,840
When the jury, which is clearly made up of
only men, vote to convict the defendant, Mr.

98
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,860
Walton seems troubled by the verdict.

99
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,889
So at face value, Where Are My Children seems
to be advocating for more access to birth

100
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:37,560
control, or at the very least more access
to information about birth control.

101
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:43,599
However, its argument is based on a notion
that we now recognize as deeply flawed: eugenics.

102
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:46,450
Eugenics was a pseudo-science that was popular
in the early 20th century.

103
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:50,620
Essentially, it’s the idea that controlling
which humans can have babies could increase

104
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,350
so-called “desirable” genetic and behavioral
traits across a population.

105
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:57,460
It was an incredibly racist and classist movement.

106
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,689
Proponents of eugenics like Karl Pearson of
the University of London argued that the relatively

107
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:05,460
high birth rate among the poor was a threat
to civilization.

108
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,750
Taken to its logical extreme, eugenics was
practiced by the Nazi regime in Germany in

109
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,479
the 1930s, paving the way for the Holocaust.

110
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,400
And while Weber’s film does argue for
access to birth control for poor women,

111
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,930
the wealthy women are punished for seeking
abortions.

112
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,199
They’re subjected to Mr. Walton’s fury,
Mrs. Walton can’t have children anymore,

113
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,740
and the housekeeper’s daughter dies.

114
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,500
In general, the film portrays the women of
the elite class as selfish and irresponsible,basically

115
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,419
shaming them for not wanting to be mothers.

116
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:35,470
That’s reinforced by Mr. Walton, who’s
presented as a noble and ultimately tragic

117
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:38,080
figure because he never gets the family he
wanted.

118
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,759
So while it’s cool that this film directed
by a woman grapples boldly with controversial

119
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,569
subject matter, it’s important to recognize
that it also falls victim to some grave misconceptions

120
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:48,280
and prejudices of the time.

121
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,980
We can think critically about this film as
a sort of cultural time capsule because of

122
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,879
our current understanding and discussions
of these complicated ideas.

123
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:58,289
But we can also evaluate this film from a
technical point of view.

124
00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:02,759
And through that lens, it’s a remarkably
sophisticated work, for being made just twenty-one

125
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,569
years after the birth of movies.

126
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:08,240
At key moments throughout the film, Weber
uses close-ups to great effect.

127
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,620
Remember that camera technique and language
was still being developed alongside actors’

128
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,620
performances.

129
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,129
When the housekeeper’s daughter realizes
she’s pregnant, Weber cuts to a closer shot

130
00:07:16,129 --> 00:07:18,319
to register her conflicted emotions.

131
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,660
Or when Dr. Malfit is sentenced to hard labor,
we get a close-up to see his desperation.

132
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,690
And that moment leads to Weber’s most
sophisticated use of dramatic irony, which

133
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,790
was also pretty new to cinema in 1916.

134
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:32,990
Dramatic Irony is where the audience understands the
full significance of a moment or action, but

135
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,289
the characters in the story don’t yet.

136
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:39,610
After Mr. Walton has read Dr. Malfit’s ledger
and found the names of his wife and her friends,

137
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:42,560
he returns home to confront them but doesn’t
speak right away.

138
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,169
We know what’s about to go down, but Mrs.
Walton and her partying friends don’t.

139
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:50,759
And that suspense makes the eruption of anger
that much more effective.

140
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,449
Now, other filmmakers at that time were good
at special effects, and Weber had skills too.

141
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:58,689
The film opens with a title card announcing:
“the great portals of Eternity,” followed

142
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:04,379
by a special effects shot of a huge gate opening
to reveal pillars, angels, and celestial clouds.

143
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:09,580
She’s using forced perspective, superimpositions,
and smoke to create an impressive, heavenly effect.

144
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,780
But Weber also used special effects to get
us to feel for the characters.

145
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:16,289
She found ways to trick our eye and affect
our heart.

146
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:20,539
Twice when characters discover they’re pregnant,
Weber superimposes a little cherub into the

147
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:24,960
shot, as though an angelic unborn soul is
whispering to the would-be mother.

148
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,189
It’s an impressive way to give us important
plot information, especially in a silent film.

149
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:32,240
But this also helps us empathize with the
characters’ conflicted emotions.

150
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,539
And the final shot of the film, where the
aging Waltons are visited by the spirits of

151
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,860
the children they never had, is undeniably
moving.

152
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:43,169
No matter how you feel about how the filmmakers
portrayed the characters and the idea of abortion,

153
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:46,940
this shifting image illustrates the pain and
regret that can come with thinking about roads

154
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,940
not taken.

155
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,890
So Where Are My Children is a landmark achievement,
representing a director at the height of her

156
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:56,210
power, combining technical mastery with a
deep understanding of complex human emotions.

157
