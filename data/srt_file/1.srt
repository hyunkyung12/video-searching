00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,460
Thanks to Curiosity Stream for supporting Crash Course.

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:06,960
Hello!

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,960
As you might have noticed, I’m not Craig
or Lily.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,880
My name’s Michael Aranda, and I’ll be
your host for the last third of Crash Course Film.

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,080
Now, since we’re getting to know each other, let me ask you a question: What’s your favorite film?

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,340
Maybe there’s a movie that makes you wanna
get fit, or become a spy, or save the world

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,220
Or maybe you love anything that Zoe Saldana
is in, because she’s just the coolest.

8
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,539
Films can have an awesome story or sloppy
lighting, dazzling special effects or characters

9
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,409
who are just straight-up stereotypes.

10
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:36,160
All these things can affect how you feel about
a movie, and whether you’d give it a thumbs

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,930
up on Netflix… because that’s a thing
now.

12
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:43,140
But they can also affect how it fits into
cinema history, and impacts the world around us.

13
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,980
We’ll think critically
about a lot of very different movies, starting

14
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:50,210
with an American classic that many people
call “the greatest film ever made.”

15
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:54,450
It came from ambition and some unusual circumstances,
with Orson Welles at the helm.

16
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:58,640
And even though it’s been a long time since
its release in 1941, this film’s technical

17
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,600
cleverness and story still resonate with audiences
today.

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,940
I’m talking, of course, about Citizen Kane.

19
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:17,540
[Intro Music Plays]

20
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,480
Calling Citizen Kane one of the best films
of all time is a complicated claim to make.

21
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,080
To be honest, the idea of ranking movies and
making a top ten list may be fun, but it’s

22
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,790
not what film criticism is really about.

23
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:33,600
It’s about thinking deeply about how the
movie works, both to us as an audience member,

24
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,580
and within history and society.

25
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,920
It’s about understanding, deconstructing,
feeling, and learning.

26
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,140
So is Citizen Kane the “Greatest Movie Ever
Made?”

27
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,090
Well, we can’t answer that, because it’s
not the question we should be asking.

28
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,630
But there’s clearly something about it that
sticks with us.

29
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,000
And maybe that something is its origin story.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,140
Orson Welles was hoisted into the spotlight
at the ripe young age of 23, when he was performing

31
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,910
with The Mercury Theatre company — a troupe
that he helped create.

32
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:03,450
In 1938, Welles directed and narrated the
radio drama The War of the Worlds, and supposedly

33
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,680
struck fear into some listeners who thought
that an actual alien invasion was happening.

34
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:12,280
Welles on the radio: We know now that in the early years of the 20th century...

35
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:17,080
This world was being watched closely by intelligences greater than man.

36
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,100
But he also caught the attention of studio

37
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:24,600
execs at RKO, one of the five film studios
that reigned during the Golden Age of Hollywood.

38
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,120
Not only that, but they gave him complete
creative control, which was, like, really

39
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:30,379
unusual at the time.

40
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:35,099
So he did what any plucky artist in his mid-20s
would do: he packed up his stuff and invited

41
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,980
his buddies from the Mercury Theatre company
to come with him to Hollywood.

42
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,689
Now, I don’t want to sell them short.

43
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:41,340
This was a group of very good actors.

44
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,349
And, despite his lack of experience with the
movie industry, Welles leapt into this project

45
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:48,129
with a lot of ambition, performing experience,
and fresh ideas.

46
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:51,689
He wanted to be involved in as many aspects
of the film as possible, from directing to

47
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:54,689
starring as the film’s eponymous Charles
Foster Kane.

48
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:57,719
Welles filled out his production team with
other talented men from Hollywood who were

49
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:02,170
itching to experiment with their craft — people
like Gregg Toland, a cameraman who contributed

50
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,359
a lot to the film’s look and technical innovations.

51
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:08,270
And Welles is credited as co-writer with Herman
J. Mankiewicz, a journalist who hopped over

52
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:12,480
into the world of filmmaking, and was an experienced
screenwriter by the time he worked on this project.

53
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,960
Citizen Kane tells the life story of a wealthy
newspaper magnate.

54
00:03:15,969 --> 00:03:20,799
The first time we meet Kane, he’s on his
deathbed in a massive mansion called Xanadu,

55
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,740
dramatically murmuring his last word: “Rosebud.”

56
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,639
The story is told in flashbacks through interviews
with people Kane once knew, like his friend

57
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:34,540
and fellow reporter Jedediah Leland, his business
manager Mr. Bernstein, and his second wife,

58
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,670
Susan Alexander Kane.

59
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,659
In the last sequence of shots, we find out
that “Rosebud” is referencing a sled he

60
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:43,450
had as a kid, before he was separated from
his family and sent to boarding school with

61
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:44,450
a new guardian.

62
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:49,200
So Citizen Kane could be a story about…
well… a lot of things: the loss of childhood,

63
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,859
human flaws, memory, or the complications
of power and wealth.

64
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:55,109
Film criticism is... pretty subjective.

65
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:59,000
But Citizen Kane is also a story that was
influenced by real life — specifically,

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,310
tycoons like the news mogul William Randolph
Hearst.

67
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,950
While Welles insisted the film wasn’t meant
to be a personal attack on Hearst, all of

68
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,720
the parallels and the fact that Mankiewicz
was a former friend of Hearst made him take

69
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,220
the film real personally.

70
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,180
And when you have a buttload of money, and
power over lots of news outlets, your grudges

71
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,299
become public.

72
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:16,298
Fast.

73
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:20,409
Initially, RKO and Orson Welles planned on
debuting Citizen Kane at the Radio City Music

74
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,230
Hall, like other big RKO movies.

75
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,710
But the venue turned it down.

76
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,700
Eventually, the the film’s release was delayed
until May 1st, 1941 in New York.

77
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,520
And the critical reception was actually pretty
good!

78
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,590
A review by Kate Cameron, published on May
2nd in the New York Daily News, called Citizen

79
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:37,340
Kane “one of the most interesting and technically
superior films that has ever come out of a

80
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,340
Hollywood studio.”

81
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,980
The controversy did mess with the film’s
commercial success, though.

82
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,010
It didn’t gain much public traction until
it was released again in the 1950s.

83
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,570
So part of what makes Citizen Kane memorable
is that it was an ambitious project, headed

84
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:52,280
by a maverick filmmaker, and had a lot of
drama around its release.

85
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,220
We humans do love ourselves some drama.

86
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,440
But the content of the film speaks for itself,
too.

87
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,890
The creators of Citizen Kane had the freedom
to play and innovate.

88
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:03,760
Many of their technical experiments changed
the way film was being used as a storytelling

89
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,000
medium — which, arguably, could be another
way to define “greatness.”

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,060
It takes a keen eye to notice some of these
tricks, or at the very least some good commentary tracks.

91
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,100
A lot of the innovation had to do with cameras.

92
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:18,630
Gregg Toland, the cinematographer, helped
pioneer the use of deep focus lenses, so that

93
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:22,590
everything in a scene is in focus at once,
not just the foreground or the background.

94
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,390
Citizen Kane doesn’t use focus to guide
your attention in a scene.

95
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:30,160
Instead, things like dialogue or movement
draw your eye to certain people at certain times.

96
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,720
It’s very much like theater, where Welles
had honed his directing and acting chops.

97
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,280
They use perspective to surprise you, like
to mess with your sense of scale when Kane

98
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,590
walks toward a normal-looking background,
only to be dwarfed by a huge window or fireplace.

99
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,710
It’s a neat visual effect, but also punctuates
the story with a little metaphor.

100
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:49,750
You’re seeing this man physically shrink
in his environment as he’s losing control

101
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,320
over his business and life.

102
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,340
And camera movements are combined with other
practical effects to really immerse you in

103
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,360
the story.

104
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,570
Take the scene where Kane is a kid playing
in the snow, while his parents are inside

105
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,710
a cabin and talking about sending him away.

106
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:05,940
The camera pulls back through a window, and
eventually stops on the other side of a dining table.

107
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,460
But, from the final framing, you can see that
the table would’ve been in the way of the

108
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,460
movement.

109
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,840
The trick is in the set: it’s actually a
mechanical table that splits and comes back together.

110
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,400
So the mise-en-scene is never broken, and
the scene can keep playing out.

111
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,900
You, the viewer, are none the wiser, because
you’re wrapped up in this incredible illusion

112
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,940
of reality the film has constructed.

113
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:28,270
Other practical tricks are used in The Inquirer
office, where Kane’s newspaper staff works.

114
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:31,640
These scenes were unusual for movies at the
time, because there are visible ceilings.

115
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,360
Now this doesn’t sound that weird.

116
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,720
Because, y’know, normal office buildings
have ceilings.

117
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,940
But production teams usually stuck lights
and sound equipment above their actors’ heads.

118
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,460
So to keep the movie magic intact, they had
to keep ceilings out of frame.

119
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,940
In this case, the lights and microphones are
still up there — just, hidden right above

120
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,690
the ceilings, which are made of muslin sheets.

121
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:52,230
They also cut out chunks of the floor to make
room for the camera, so they could get dramatic

122
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:55,210
low-angle shots, making the actors look larger
than life.

123
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:59,300
The trick to Citizen Kane is that all these
effects — which are everywhere — don’t

124
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,580
feel like effects in the same way a CGI dragon
does.

125
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,660
They subtly draw you into the world.

126
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,780
For instance, Welles often blends matte drawings
with physical sets, to make everything seem

127
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,960
more immersive, despite a limited budget.

128
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,840
This is how they create the beginning of the
film, leading us toward the window of Xanadu

129
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,950
and Kane’s deathbed.

130
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,360
Plus, it’s how they make the inside of Xanadu,
the outside of The Inquirer building, and

131
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,290
audiences during the big campaign speech and
opera.

132
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:25,620
These tricks were accomplished with optical
printers, which let them shoot and light two

133
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,710
images or scenes separately, and stitch them
into one.

134
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:32,111
Effects also let them add visual twists to
the story, in ways Welles couldn’t with

135
00:07:32,111 --> 00:07:33,111
live theatre.

136
00:07:33,111 --> 00:07:37,070
Like when Susan Alexander is performing in
the opera, we crane up from the stage and fade

137
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:40,960
into the rafters to see the opera’s production
team reacting to how awful her performance is.

138
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,120
The transition is precise and deliberate,
and nowhere near as easy as dropping a fade

139
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,800
into a digital video editor today.

140
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,000
Now, maybe you noticed some of these technical
tricks, but they’re done well and not obvious

141
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,830
unless you’re paying close attention.

142
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,790
And that’s one of the coolest things about
good filmmaking.

143
00:07:55,790 --> 00:08:00,510
But, a lot of the time, what makes our favorite
movies so memorable is just a well-told story.

144
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:03,990
And, if you think about it, Citizen Kane doesn’t
really have a mind-blowing plot.

145
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:09,280
It’s a straightforward tale about a powerful,
wealthy newspaper tycoon and his shortcomings,

146
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,031
and the dialogue is all pretty crisp and generic.

147
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:15,090
You get a newsreel summary of Kane’s life
at the beginning, but it’s mostly told through

148
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,860
flashbacks, and they’re part of what make
the film feel so true to life.

149
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,490
And even though it’s easy to link Charles
Foster Kane with William Randolph Hearst,

150
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:25,650
this archetype of a driven, powerful jerk
who just wants people to love him is pretty

151
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,740
relatable to a lot of us — even Welles himself.

152
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,580
So you might see things you like and hate
about yourself in Kane, or Susan Alexander’s

153
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,820
naive optimism, or Jedediah Leland and his
disillusionment with a friend.

154
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,958
Honestly, the fact that it’s his childhood
sled isn’t the most profound or surprising

155
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,769
twist out there, it’s not like there are
hidden identities or “I see dead people.”

156
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:46,639
But, you have to admit, the film goes all-in
on the idea of lost childhood.

157
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,839
Kane drowns his feelings in material objects
and tries to live vicariously through Susan

158
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:54,990
Alexander’s youth, telling her, “we’re
going to be a great opera star.”

159
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:59,370
Or maybe you agree with the film critic Pauline
Kael that the sled is just kinda gimmicky.

160
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:03,050
But critics, including her, don’t call Citizen
Kane “great” because it makes you realize

161
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,670
profound things about life, the universe,
and everything.

162
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,040
Every scene isn’t a masterpiece, but the
film holds up over time and people seem to

163
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,829
get a lot out of it — historically, technically,
or narratively.

164
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:16,010
And, like I mentioned before, the whole idea
of “the best film of all time” is ultimately

165
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:16,920
kind of… silly.

166
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:22,019
It’s more about understanding why and how
we make movies that mean so much to us, or

167
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,019
to the world.

168
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:25,160
And that’s pretty beautiful in itself.

169
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,790
Next time, we’ll take a hard left turn into
an action/adventure/horror film that’s almost

170
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:32,410
as quotable as Casablanca, James Cameron’s
Aliens.

171
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,620
And if you want to watch along with us,

172
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,360
there's a full list of movies in the description!

173
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,720

Where Hawking takes you on a journey through the stars and around our planet

178
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,860
to talk about his favorite places to go.

179
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,860
Everything from Saturn to Santa Barbara.

180
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,880
Plus, he shares his own stories of curiosity and perseverance. It’s really cool!

181
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,940
I mean… it’s Stephen Hawking so you know it’s cool.

182
