1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,180
Hi!

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,260
I’m not Craig.

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,380
But you’re in the right place; this is still
Crash Course Film.

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:11,120
My name is Lily Gladstone, and I’m excited
to spend the next fifteen episodes with

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,610
you exploring film production – how movies
actually get made.

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,650
We’ll talk about all those jobs that are
listed in the credits, and how movies take

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,910
a huge amount of collaboration, whether
you have a crew of tens or thousands.

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,881
We’ll go behind the scenes to see how movies
are planned, shot, and edited, and take a

9
00:00:24,881 --> 00:00:26,589
peek at all the equipment involved.

10
00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:29,980
And we’ll learn how films are marketed and
distributed, whether they go to movie theaters

11
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:30,980
or straight into your home.

12
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,900
But, before we get anywhere near lights, camera, action...

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:38,680
We need to start with a road map that gives everyone in the cast and crew the directions they need to make a film.

14
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,200
It’s time to talk about the screenplay.

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:53,040
[Music Plays]

16
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,400
In most of these videos, we’ll be learning about how the vast majority of narrative fiction films get made.

17
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,240
And to do that, we need to start with the
screenplay.

18
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,579
A screenplay is a written version of a movie.

19
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:03,120
Think of it as a blueprint.

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,060
It’s not the final product; it’s a set
of plans to guide a team of artists, craftspeople,

21
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,950
and engineers as they produce a film.

22
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:13,280
Every screenplay is formatted with three basic
elements: sluglines, action, and dialogue.

23
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,540
Each new scene begins with a slugline.

24
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,120
It’s written in all-capital letters and
acts as a code to convey information to the crew.

25
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,060
A slugline might look something like this:
INT.

26
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,780
Here the INT. stands for interior, meaning

27
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,500
this scene takes place inside.

28
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,390
If the scene takes place outside, the slugline
would start with EXT. for exterior.

29
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:33,090
The second word tells us where the scene
takes place, which is important information

30
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,290
for a lot of the crew.

31
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,650
The location scout needs to find somewhere
to film the scene, the production designer

32
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,380
alters the location to make it fit the world
of the film, and the cinematographer decides

33
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,380
how to light it.

34
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,590
But before any of that happens, the line producer
uses the location to help figure out how much

35
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,590
the film is going to cost.

36
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:52,400
The same goes for the last word in the slugline,
which describes when the scene takes place,

37
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,660
usually either day or night.

38
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:57,130
Besides giving information to the crew, this
can affect the cost of the movie, partially

39
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,250
because shooting at night is more expensive.

40
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,870
After the slugline comes the action.

41
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,140
These are short, assertive sentences that
describe who’s in the scene and what they’re doing.

42
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,380
Since you watch a movie unfold over time,
the action is written in present tense.

43
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,878
So instead of writing: “Iron Man flew
across the sky,” you’d write:

44
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,170
“Iron Man flies across the sky.”

45
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,189
The action is also limited to what the audience
can see and hear.

46
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:18,569
In a novel, you can describe what a character
is thinking and feeling.

47
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:20,950
Something like: “Luke Skywalker feels miserable.”

48
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:25,709
In the screenplay, you’d have to write an
action to show us how he feels, like:

49
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:27,660
“Luke Skywalker hangs his head and wipes away a tear.”

50
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,159
There are a lot of guidelines and tricks to
writing action lines, but the most important

51
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:33,019
rule is: show, don’t tell.

52
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:36,959
Remember that this is where the thoughts,
feelings, and themes of the screenplay are

53
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,590
turned into actions you can see.

54
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,859
And the final piece of a screenplay is the
dialogue.

55
00:02:41,859 --> 00:02:43,599
These are the words spoken by characters.

56
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,689
Feature-length screenplays are usually between
90 and 120 pages.

57
00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:49,609
And each page typically becomes about a minute
of the final film.

58
00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:52,259
This is more of an average than a hard rule,
by the way.

59
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:55,780
Some dialogue-heavy pages will likely be shorter
than a minute, while some pages with lots

60
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,760
of action may end up longer once the film
is shot and edited.

61
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,349
Now, some stories are better suited to the
screen than others.

62
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:04,780
Different media have different strengths,
so what makes a good poem or graphic novel

63
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,170
won’t necessarily make a good movie.

64
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:10,980
A film creates an immersive visual world – that
“illusion of reality” we keep talking about.

65
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,900
And within that world, it can tell a story
packed with complex ideas and emotions.

66
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,959
Movies tend to focus on three main things:
a protagonist, which is the film’s main

67
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,251
character; a goal or objective, which is something
the protagonist wants; and obstacles, which

68
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:26,579
is whatever’s standing between the protagonist
and their goal.

69
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:28,819
Think about a heist movie.

70
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:32,310
Maybe a master criminal wants to steal the
world’s biggest diamond, but finds herself

71
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,990
facing off against a rival thief.

72
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:38,670
Or a romantic comedy, where an awkward-but-loveable
introvert wants to date their outgoing neighbor,

73
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,279
but is afraid to leave the comfort of his
routine.

74
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:42,299
Protagonist.

75
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:43,310
Goal.

76
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,330
Obstacle.

77
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:48,390
These are the building blocks of a screen
story, and it’s from these that everything

78
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,430
else emerges, like setting, character, theme,
and tone.

79
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:55,090
Now, the protagonist doesn’t necessarily
have to be the story’s hero.

80
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:59,359
Films are full of anti-heroes like Travis
Bickle in Taxi Driver, or accidental villains

81
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:01,450
like William H. Macy’s
character in Fargo.

82
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:05,520
Usually, a movie’s protagonist will grow
or change in some way in pursuit of their goal.

83
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,920
The master criminal might learn humility as
she attempts to steal the diamond.

84
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,590
Or maybe the introvert overcomes his social
anxiety to befriend his love interest.

85
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,380
But the most important thing for the screenwriter

86
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,079
is finding ways to make all of this come across visually.

87
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,860
One way to do that is by following what’s
known as the “Hero’s Journey.”

88
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,650
This is a template for character development
that was popularized by the American mythologist

89
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,650
Joseph Campbell.

90
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:29,340
By looking at myths from cultures all over
the world, Campbell identified twelve common

91
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,100
steps taken by main characters as they transform
over the course of a story.

92
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,070
These range from resisting the call to adventure
and meeting their mentor, to facing their

93
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,920
biggest fear and surviving a final ordeal,
armed with everything they’ve learned along the way.

94
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,100
The Hero’s Journey was famously used by
George Lucas when writing Luke Skywalker’s

95
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,480
journey from Tatooine farm kid to Jedi knight.

96
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,970
Some screenwriters love it, while others think
it’s a stale, overused formula.

97
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:55,010
But if you’re looking to write your first
screenplay, it’s not a bad place to start.

98
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:59,170
Once you have some characters and plot points,
you need to throw some conflict in the mix.

99
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:03,510
Conflict moves a story forward, and helps
us identify with the protagonist as they’re

100
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,750
struggling against their obstacles.

101
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,380
And screenplays can have different kinds of
conflict.

102
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,000
External conflict occurs whenever the protagonist
encounters physical obstacles.

103
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,440
Take the first Lord of the Rings film, The
Fellowship of the Ring.

104
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,040
Our protagonist, Frodo, has a goal: to destroy
the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom.

105
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,500
No problem, right?

106
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,110
Except, in order to get to Mount Doom, he
has to travel across the known world, avoid

107
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:29,680
an endless army of orcs and monsters, and
outwit this powerful fiery eye that’s searching for him.

108
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,360
Not to mention, he’s the shortest guy in
the movie and they make him walk barefoot

109
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,390
the whole way.

110
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,580
They don’t even give the poor guy shoes!

111
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:42,330
On the other hand, internal conflict is when
the protagonist wrestles with some emotional

112
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,830
or psychological obstacle.

113
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:48,430
For Frodo, that could be his ignorance of
the wider world, a lack of faith in himself,

114
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,930
or even his jealousy and selfishness.

115
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:55,660
Usually, the more conflict the protagonist
faces, the more they transform to overcome it.

116
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,800
But that doesn’t mean that the fate of the
world has to be at stake in every single screenplay.

117
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,040
The writer should scale the conflict to fit
the kind of story they’re telling.

118
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,420
Like, in Bridesmaids, Kristin Wiig’s character just wants to be a good maid of honor to her best friend.

119
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:12,880
She faces a lot of external conflict, from
a rival bridesmaid to some severely undercooked Brazilian food.

120
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,560
And internally, she feels conflicted
about her best friend getting married, the

121
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,610
loss of her bakery, and her self-worth.

122
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:24,750
The universe isn’t going to implode if she
doesn’t succeed, but we still empathize

123
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,360
with her as she struggles to achieve her goal.

124
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:31,100
Now, once you have some ideas for the story
you want to tell, how are you supposed to

125
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,310
organize them all?

126
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,800
Screenwriters often use something called Three
Act Structure, which is based on theories

127
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,010
by the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle
from more than 2,000 years ago.

128
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:43,210
The idea is simple: that every story has a
beginning, middle, and end; and that certain

129
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,270
kinds of events happen in each section.

130
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:49,250
Act One sets up the world of the screenplay,
introducing us to the characters, and identifying

131
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,650
the protagonist and their goal.

132
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,560
In the Wizard of Oz, most of Act One takes
place in Kansas.

133
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,860
It’s the black-and-white part.

134
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,550
We get external conflicts between Dorothy
and that mean lady down the street, as well

135
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:02,800
as Aunt Em.We also learn that Dorothy is unsatisfied
with her life and dreams of something more

136
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,460
exciting, somewhere over the rainbow.

137
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,620
Once she’s transported to Oz, she meets
her antagonist, the Wicked Witch of the West,

138
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,870
and we learn that her goal is to find the
wizard so she can go home.

139
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:16,740
In Act Two, the protagonist faces increasingly
difficult conflicts as they pursue their goal.

140
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,300
They meet allies, encounter successes and
setbacks, and are often brought to a point

141
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,300
of hopelessness.

142
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:27,220
For Dorothy, this is when the wizard refuses
to take her home unless she can defeat the

143
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,220
Wicked Witch.

144
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,360
To get what she wants, she’ll have to face
her fears and do the seemingly-impossible.

145
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,690
Finally, Act Three contains the climax of
the film.

146
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:39,740
There’s usually some epic face-off between
the protagonist and antagonist, the person

147
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,150
who most directly opposes them.

148
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:44,860
That confrontation usually decides whether
or not the protagonist achieves their goal.

149
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,710
And in most Hollywood screenplays, they do.

150
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,180
Dorothy gets back to Kansas.

151
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,620
Luke Skywalker blows up the Death Star.

152
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,060
Simba defeats Scar and restores the circle
of life to the Pride Lands.But the guidelines

153
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,130
of the Three Act Structure are just that.

154
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,130
Guidelines.

155
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:01,590
Foreign and independent movies can have more
ambiguous endings, from the open-ended final

156
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:07,200
shots of The Wrestler or Birdman, to the heartbreak
of Brokeback Mountain or The Death of Mr. Lazarescu.

157
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,200
Films like M*A*S*H, Traffic, or Magnolia split
their stories up among different protagonists,

158
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,340
while movies like Pulp Fiction and Memento
scramble time, telling their stories out of order.

159
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:20,860
And films like Mulholland Drive, Rashomon,
or Man with a Movie Camera seem to reject

160

162
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:31,240

or invent their own, the clear, concise, visual

163
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,140
