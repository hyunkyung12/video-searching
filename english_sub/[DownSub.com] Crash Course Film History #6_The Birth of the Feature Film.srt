1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,950
If you’ve been joining me from the beginning
of our journey through the history of film,

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,119
you might’ve noticed something.
None of the films that I’ve talked about

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:11,531
so far look like the movies you see today.
Yes, Ryan Gosling got very little play in

4
00:00:11,531 --> 00:00:14,680
the late 1800s. But what I really mean is:
We haven’t talked much about story. Character.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,840
Narrative.
Like, you don’t go the the megaplex today,

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,480
buy a bunch of popcorn, and sit down to watch
movies of trains entering stations, or horses

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,520
running in slow motion.

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,640
That’s because, there was a period in the history of film –

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,620
a really important and
kind of problematic one – when film evolved,

10
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,920
from a technical curiosity into a powerful
visual storytelling machine.

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,570
Artists, technicians, and engineers started
devising ways of making films longer, more

12
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,010
complex, and more narrative. This is when
it began to develop its own language, through

13
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,839
the power of editing.
And the way films were made, and watched,

14
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:42,870
became more familiar, too.
Film studios began to pop up. Movie theaters

15
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,980
proliferated. Systems were created to develop
film, shuttle movies from theater to theater,

16
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,800
and publicize them to hungry audiences.

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,519
As film’s physical and economic imprint became more stable, so too did its visual language, taking a shape that more closely

18
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:56,869
resembles the movies you see today.
And this was due in large part to the exhaustive

19
00:00:56,869 --> 00:01:02,370
work of D. W. Griffith, a failed actor-turned-filmmaker
whose own legacy was as complicated and sprawling

20
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,220
as one of his films.
It’s time to tackle D. W. Griffith and the

21
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,680
arrival of the feature film.

22
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:19,680
[Opening Titles]

23
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,260
As the film industry took root, that whole
system began to take a shape that’s recognizable

24
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,200
to us modern movie-goers.
First, there’s the studio.

25
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,120
When an entertainment company grows big enough
to have its own production facilities – from

26
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,320
offices and sound stages to props, costumes,
and editing rooms, we call it a studio. The

27
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,030
studio is where the films are made by the
production company.

28
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,420
Second is the distributor. Its job is to market
the movie to its audience, book the films

29
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,860
onto screens, and then deliver them to the
theaters. So the distributor actually gets

30
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,340
the films out into the world.

31
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,520
Thank you, distributor. I like watching movies.

32
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,780
Finally, we have the exhibitor. This is the company that actually provides the film to
the audience.

33
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,220
Movie theaters and big theater chains are
exhibitors, as are streaming services and

34
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,550
DVD rental companies.
In the first few decades of film production

35
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,090
in the US, many of these companies were vertically
integrated. That means that the studio owned

36
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,600
the production company. And the distribution
company. And even the exhibition company.

37
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,250
While this made a lot of sense for the owners of the studios – to be able to control the

38
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,699
process from production to exhibition – it
would eventually be ruled a monopoly.

39
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:13,069
At that point, the studios would be forced
to break off their distribution and exhibition

40
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:16,600
businesses and open the field to competition.
But that came later. In the early days – from

41
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:23,770
about 1907 to 1913 – the major film studios
had tremendous power... like me.

42
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,960
Eager to please a growing and ravenous audience,
these studios looked to the success that manufacturers

43
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,940
like Henry Ford were having with mass production,
and tried to make films in a kind of “assembly

44
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,400
line” process.
Write the film, shoot the film, edit the film,

45
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,480
distribute the film, screen the film, and
repeat. As fast as possible, and as often

46
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,300
as possible. That's how you make art!

47
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,290
It was about quantity, not quality. If the

48
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,980
movies were good, that was cool; but it wasn’t
the goal. Experimentation of any kind was

49
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,690
discouraged. Time was money.
The standard length of these films was about

50
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:52,550
10 to 16 minutes, or one reel of film. The
creative name they came up for these films?

51
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,750
“One reelers.”
But despite the flattening out of quality,

52
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,430
this was a period of astronomical growth for
the film industry, in the US and western Europe

53
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,770
in particular.
Demand was through the roof, and filmmakers

54
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:04,170
were working overtime trying to meet it.
They were also stealing. Copyright law was

55
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:08,349
still in its infancy, and – as with books
prior to 1893 – most films were considered

56
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:11,730
to be in the public domain. This meant that
prints could be stolen and duplicated without

57
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,550
legal consequences.
It was kind of the Wild West, and it can be

58
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,940
as confusing to make sense of as it was to
live through. YEE-HAW!

59
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,860
So let’s see if we can work

60
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,459
our way through it.
The person in the best position to bring some

61
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:25,750
order to the chaos of this burgeoning film
industry is our old friend Thomas Edison.

62
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,490
Edison claimed that he held the patents on
several elements in almost all motion picture

63
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:33,030
cameras and projectors. So he believed he
was entitled to a cut of every camera and

64
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,750
projector sold, as well as every movie that
was made, sold, or screened.

65
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,569
And who was the competitor who most got under
his skin? His former lab assistant – and

66
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:43,370
the man who actually invented the first motion
picture camera – William Dickson.

67
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:46,681
After he left Edison, Dickson started his
own production company called Biograph, which

68
00:03:46,681 --> 00:03:50,480
made films using a camera similar to Edison’s
kinetograph, but different enough to survive

69
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,550
a lawsuit.
And sue Edison did. No fewer than 20 times

70
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,360
in just a few years. I mean, Edison was suing everybody.

71
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,900
This era became known as the Patent Wars,
as gangs of men connected to Edison were known

72
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,220
to show up at independent film studios and
threaten the filmmakers.

73
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,260
Eventually Edison realized that he was wasting
time and money in court. Independent producers

74
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,530
and distributors were popping up all over
the place, and he was left playing this big,

75
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:13,220
high-stakes game of whack-a-mole. Sounds like fun, but it's not... trust me.

76
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:18,379
So he proposed a truce, and partnered with Dickson’s Biograph and eight other major
film studios, the country’s leading film

77
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:20,858
distributor, and George Eastman, the biggest
supplier of film stock.

78
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:24,169
Together, they created the Motion Picture
Patents Company, also known as “the Trust,”

79
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:27,509
an effective monopoly on film production and
distribution in the United States.

80
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:30,669
Instead of selling films to distributors and
exhibitors, studios would rent them out, and

81
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:34,289
retain all legal rights to them. This gave
studios control over which films were screened,

82
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:38,700
how often, and in which theaters. Sounds great! ... no it doesn't.

83
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:44,340
Plus, because Eastman was a member of 
the MPCC, independent film companies couldn’t
get their hands on film stock without permission.

84
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,340
Which meant that Edison got to decide who
could and couldn’t make movies!

85
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,460
In addition to the stranglehold that the Trust
put on the industry, it also promoted the

86
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,370
assembly line process of film production.
As a result, the films themselves by and large

87
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:59,110
became unimaginative, stale, and static.
But, the independents refused to go quietly.

88
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:03,300
They banded together to form groups aimed
at resisting Edison and the MPPC. The last

89
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,479
and most successful of these was the Motion
Picture Distributing and Sales Company.

90
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,070
Many of them also decided to move their production
facilities as far away from Edison’s New

91
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:14,360
Jersey headquarters as possible. Can you guess
where they ended up?... Not Synecdoche.

92
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,449
That’s right: Hollywood, California, which
had the added benefits of year-round sunshine

93
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:23,800
and a diverse and handy assortment of natural landscapes. And earthquakes. That's not a benefit it's just something they had.

94
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,819
Finally, in 1918, the United States Supreme
Court broke up the MPPC and ordered film studios

95
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:33,030
to sever their distribution and exhibition
branches, ending Edison’s run as American

96
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,050
film’s great gatekeeper.
While all this was going on, films themselves

97
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,520
were struggling to change, and though no one
knew it yet, features were on the way.

98
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,870
A feature film is a movie with a running time
long enough to be considered the principal

99
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,849
film in a program. Usually, features clock
in at between 70 and 130 minutes.

100
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:51,339
When Edison’s posse was in control, the
MPPC strictly forbade films longer than one

101
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:54,559
reel, or 10 to 16 minutes.
So filmmakers began looking for creative ways

102
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,860
around the length restriction. Some would
make two reelers and then show them in a serial

103
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,180
format – the first reel this week, the second
next week.

104
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,680
Sort of like what they did with the last Harry
Potter book. I’m still not over that.

105
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,250
Three films in particular paved the way for
features by convincing studios that longer

106
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,899
films could be commercially successful.

107
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:13,449
The first was The Crusaders, an Italian film
from 1911 that was four reels long. The second

108
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:17,069
was another 4-reeler, a French film called
The Loves of Queen Elizabeth, that starred

109
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:20,490
megastar Sarah Bernhardt and made a ton of
money in 1912.

110
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:25,529
And finally, Quo Vadis, a 1913 Italian spectacle
that boasted huge crowd scenes and big special

111
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:28,949
effects, and ran nine reels in length!
And working steadily through all of this was

112
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:32,530
a director named D. W. Griffith. The son of
a Confederate colonel, Griffith was a failed

113
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:36,249
stage actor who happened to be on an Edwin
S. Porter set one day and fell in love with

114
00:06:36,249 --> 00:06:37,800
film.
Within a few months, he was directing one

115
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,620
reelers at an astonishing rate – he would
go on to make more than 450 in less than a

116
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,229
decade.
What’s even more impressive, he was able

117
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:46,559
to integrate an actor’s understanding of
nuance and character with the film grammar

118
00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:49,889
laid down by pioneers like Porter.
He made incredible innovations in how a film

119
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:53,159
could be shot and cut. And most importantly,
he grounded all of his new techniques in the

120
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:56,370
service of character and story.
For example, Griffith is credited with innovating

121
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,249
the close-up – cutting to a shot of a character’s
face at a moment of high drama. This also

122
00:07:00,249 --> 00:07:05,200
required – and rewarded – a more subtle
style of acting than film actors often delivered.

123
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,200
Can we cut to a close up, Nick?
Nick: No.

124
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,660
Drama, right? Are we in a close up?
Nick: No.

125
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,400
Why?

126
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,920
He used insert shots – close-ups of objects
or characters’ hands – to draw attention

127
00:07:12,929 --> 00:07:16,800
to symbolic props or key narrative moments.
He used increasingly extensive flashbacks

128
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,740
to add depth to characters and their stories.
And he found ingenious ways to use cross-cutting

129
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,699
to engage the audience on a deep level, to
make us empathize with his characters, to

130
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:26,179
really care about what was happening to them.

131
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:30,409
It’s remarkable how modern his films feel
today. So I'm gonna remark on it.

132
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:33,920
Sure, they’re in black and white, and they’re short, and they don’t star
Captain America or Vin Diesel’s car or an

133
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,800
Oscar-worthy bucket of tears.
But the way the shots are framed and arranged

134
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,219
hasn’t changed all that much since Griffith.
And Griffith’s biggest achievement was the

135
00:07:40,219 --> 00:07:43,139
film Birth of a Nation.
This is the film that paved the way for feature-length

136
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,699
films to become the gold standard. It was
successful enough – both financially and

137
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:50,389
in terms of its massive scope mixed with its
detailed attention to character, emotion,

138
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:53,930
and story – that audiences demanded more
like it, and would no longer be satisfied

139
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:58,069
with a program of half a dozen one reelers.
Birth of a Nation is also a deeply racist

140
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:01,559
film. It offers an extremely sympathetic view
of white southern former slaveholders under

141
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:03,520
Reconstruction.
The heroes at the end of the film are the

142
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,219
reborn Ku Klux Klan, who ride across the countryside,
racing to save poor white southerners besieged

143
00:08:08,219 --> 00:08:11,479
by mobs of murderous former slaves.
It’s stunningly effective in its use of

144
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:14,879
cross-cutting and screen direction; it’s
also profoundly disturbing in its message

145
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,529
and imagery.
This is the double-edged sword of D. W. Griffith:

146
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:22,219
a master of cinema on one hand, and an apologist
for a legacy of hatred, violence, and persecution,

147
00:08:22,219 --> 00:08:25,370
whose work inspired actual hate groups to
reconstitute in this country.

148
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:29,360
The film faced protests at the time, particularly
in places like Chicago, where people of all

149
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,529
ethnic backgrounds objected to its twisted
view of history and race relations.

150
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:36,260
And there was a very small but vibrant underground
African American film industry at the time

151
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,450
that responded to the racism of Birth of a Nation with films of their own.

152
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:43,309
Most famous was Oscar Micheaux’s Within
Our Gates, released in 1920, the story of

153
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:46,460
a mixed-race school teacher who encounters
violence and prejudice as she tries to make

154
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,410
a better life for herself.
The most successful African American filmmaker

155
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,720
of the time, Micheaux examined the racial
climate in the United States in a way that’s

156
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,510
as nuanced and searing as Griffith’s is
bigoted and inaccurate.

157
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:59,160
Whatever else it is, Birth of a Nation marked
the end of the Silent Shorts era, and challenged

158
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,450
film studios to allow filmmakers to make longer,
more complex films that told grand stories

159
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:07,350
with unique characters and powerful emotions.
The pictures may have moved before Griffith,

160
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:10,680
but now the audience was moved too.
Today we talked about how the film industry

161
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,340
is divided up into studios, distributors,
and exhibitors – and how all those systems

162
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:18,780
used to be controlled by the same people.
Then, we discussed the independent filmmakers

163
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:22,780
who resisted the monopolies, started up Hollywood,
and began creating longer feature films instead

164
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:27,580
of one reelers. We introduced D.W. Griffith who was an innovator and master of film language,

165
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,620
but his biggest achievement was a film cloaked in hate and racism.

166
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,860
And next time, we’ll talk about how the

167
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,140
violence and politics of World War I influenced
cinema, and how filmmakers began to experiment

168
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,200
with horror, psychological twists, and the
distortion of reality.

169
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,560
