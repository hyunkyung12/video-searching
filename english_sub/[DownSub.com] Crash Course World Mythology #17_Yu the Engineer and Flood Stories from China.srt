00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,460
Hey there! I'm Mike Rugnetta 
and this is CrashCourse Mythology.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:07,900
Today, we're going to continue to inundate you with myths about the floods.

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:12,240
And as you can see Thoth isn't going to be caught without a raft this time around.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,299
Last week, we looked at the many mythic traditions that feature a story

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,780
about a god or gods bringing
a flood to destroy humanity

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,240
or at least teach him a real good lesson.

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,020
Today, we're headed to China. Anchors away!

8
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:41,340
So before we get started for real, now is probably a good time to mention that I don't speak Chinese

9
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,360
So I'm going to do my best, but, be forewarned

10
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,340
pronunciation carnage is about to happen.

11
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:48,860
Bao Qian (I'm sorry...)

12
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,540
Longtime CrashCourse fans will remember some of today's main story since it was featured in

13
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,480
The first season of CrashCourse World History. I'm talking about our old friend

14
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,060
Yu the Engineer. 
But first let's take a step back and remember that

15
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:06,360
in China real, non-mythical flooding 
is a big and actual deal.

16
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,820
Thousands of years of flood control project have made sure that flooding, especially a kind of two main rivers:

17
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,000
The Yellow or Huang He, and

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,400
Yangtze, don't wipe out food supply.

19
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,500
And inability to control floods was seen as

20
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,000
a major shortcoming for emperors 
and often caused social unrest.

21
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,530
Many people believed floods to be natural disasters brought by divine forces

22
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,340
demonstrating their displeasure with the emperor. And of course if the floods destroyed the food supply

23
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,078
hungry folks are gonna rebel -- just ask Limos,
Greek Goddess of Hunger.

24
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,700
I wonder if there's a Greek god of being hangry?

25
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,980
So in China anyone who was able to prevent floods or ameliorate their effects

26
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:49,060
would be considered at the very least a hero and
at the most possibly a god.

27
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:55,000
In one version of the Chinese flood myth the mythical king Shun had lost heaven's favor and the rivers

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,120
started to overflow.
Yu came to the rescue taming the flood.

29
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,500
Shun was so impressed that he eventually handed his title over to Yu.

30
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,760
This is the mythical origin of
the first Chinese dynasty, the Xia.

31
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,820
In another version of the flood myth the flood just happens, for no apparent reason.

32
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:16,180
The High God, Di,
called upon the demigod Gun to stop it.

33
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,720
Gun tried his hardest for nine years,
but eventually admits defeat.

34
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,260
After Gun gives up his son Yu takes up the task.
Kinda like the family business.

35
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,820
Fortunately for China, Yu has better luck than his father.

36
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:34,100
He works for 13 years straight
to end the flood and save the world.

37
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,420
The entire time Yu is the model of diligence and selflessness.

38
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,960
In 13 years, he never once returns home to his wife.

39
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,200
According to one story, he passes his house three times and never goes in.

40
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:54,180
With his dedication, Yu became a model for future Chinese rulers, the world's first workaholic...

41
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,540
and a pretty bad husband, it seems.

42
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,360
During those 13 years, Yu tried lots of different flood control methods.

43
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,000
But he also called upon a number of mythical helpers.

44
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,600
His main solution to the flooding

45
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,640
was to redirect the floodwaters out to the sea often by building levees, canals and dikes.

46
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,220
One time he asked for help from
Yinglong, the Responding Dragon,

47
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:19,580
who used his tail to create a floodwater shifting barricade directing the water out to sea.

48
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,280
Very cooperative for a dragon.

49
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,800
In another version of the story, Yu and the dragon also get help from a giant black turtle.

50
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,540
Yu also got some help from Hebo,
the God of the Yellow River.

51
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,440
Previously Hebo was a human who drowned while ferrying across the Yellow River.

52
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,800
But the Supreme God took pity on him 
and made him God of the River.

53
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:45,400
Yu started his flood control efforts at the Yellow River when a god with the face of a man and the body of a fish

54
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,500
came out of the water and explained that he was Hebo.

55
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,840
He gave Yu a detailed map 
of the locations of China's rivers

56
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,180
to help him get a better picture of 
what he was up against .

57
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,640
Yay! Part human part animal gods! Right, Thoth?

58
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,020
As part of his efforts,
Yu also had to defeat a number of monsters.

59
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,420
He had to kill Xiangliu,
a nine-headed monster with the habit of

60
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,700
turning perfectly good land into uninhabitable marshes.

61
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:12,020
Some of the other monsters he managed to spare and even tame, but one creature

62
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:16,820
Wuzhiqi, the monster of the Huai River,
gave Yu particular trouble.

63
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:22,940
Wuzhiqi and his followers made gales and storms that prevented Yu from controlling the flood.

64
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:27,840
This made Yu mad so he gathered all the gods together and ordered them to clear out the monsters.

65
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,300
Wuzhiqi's monster-god followers were frightened and they surrendered to Yu who put them in jail.

66
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,480
Wuzhiqi himself then appeared in the form of a monkey

67
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:41,300
with a green chest, white head,
yellow eyes and white paws...

68
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,140
Oh, and also the power to stretch his neck 100 feet and the strength of nine elephants.

69
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,260
So that's one scary monkey.

70
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:51,280
Yu, who is not only a diligent worker but also a consummate manager,

71
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,620
delegated the job of taming Wuzhiqi to a number of subordinates.

72
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,580
Most weren't up to the task until Gengchen,
who chained up Wuzhiqi by his long neck

73
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,480
and put a golden bell through his nose.

74
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,420
After that the Huai river wasn't trouble anymore.

75
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:11,660
But of all the assistance that Yu received
over his 13-year battle with flooding,

76
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,820
no one was more helpful than his wife Tushan-shi.

77
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,200
Yu was too busy to come home
but Tushan-shi didn't take that sitting down.

78
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,780
Understanding the importance of the flooding, 
she worked to find ways to help.

79
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:27,320
This is clear in one of our favorite Yu flood stories. 
Favorite because Yu...

80
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,400
Spoiler Alert!

81
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,880
changes Into a bear.

82
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,800
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

83
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,540
Yu is starting to excavate a mountain in order to channel the floodwaters into the sea.

84
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:40,140
Before he leaves for work, 
he tells Tushan-shi, who's nine-months pregnant,

85
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,300
to bring him food whenever she hears a drum.

86
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,020
Then he goes off to the mountain
and transforms Into a bear

87
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,080
Because duh...

88
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,540
bears are much better
at tunneling through mountains than man.

89
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:57,260
While he's working, he steps on the drum by mistake. 
Tushan-shi hears the drum and brings food to Yu.

90
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,860
But Yu is busy controlling floods and also,
you know... bearing around,

91
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,860
so he fails to notice his wife.

92
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,500
Tushan-shi is standing there,
looking at this bear of a husband

93
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,480
and she's filled with shame to see him in this form.

94
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,900
Because apparently it's a shameful thing.

95
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,040
Bear etiquette was pretty strict back then, I guess.

96
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:22,420
Tushan-shi runs away, and as she reaches the mountains base she starts to change into stone.

97
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:27,220
When Yu finishes his work for the day and turns back into a man, he finds her.

98
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,900
But Tushan-shi had already turned to rock.

99
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:35,200
Yu politely asked the rock
if she could give him the baby.

100
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:43,520
Tushan-shi obliges, splitting open on her north side.
Out of this fissure, their son, Qi, is born.

101
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,160
This is the same Qi that would later
become the first Xia emperor.

102
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,840
Though it's unclear what Qi thought about having a rock for a mom and a sometimes-bear for a dad...

103
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,520
That must have been tough on Parent-Teacher Conference night.

104
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,640
Thank you, Thought Bubble.

105
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:02,340
So, stories Involving the Great Yu are quite different from the Jewish and Mesopotamian flood myths

106
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,340
we looked at in the last episode.

107
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:09,120
For one thing, these floods don't represent the gods' attempt to wipe out humanity.

108
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,060
In fact, they don't seem to kill many people at all, at least not in the way the ancient Near East El Niño did.

109
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:20,060
The emperor survives,
so does Yu's wife/rock plus the giant turtle. Go turtle!

110
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:25,020
Yu is righteous like Utanapishtim who survives the flood in the epic of Gilgamesh.

111
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,740
He's chosen to save the world, and he does so,

112
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:32,660
but more through his intellect and hard work than the intervention of the gods.

113
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:37,260
I imagine that Yu would have really been grateful for direction on how to build dams and levees,

114
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:40,760
but he had to figure it out for himself,
for 13 years.

115
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:46,480
Yu's devotion to duty in working to save China,
which, in myths, stands for the whole world,

116
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:51,420
makes him a model human being, and because of the way the stories end, a model emperor.

117
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:57,720
He does everything he can to improve the lives of his people by saving their homes and fields.

118
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,960
He works tirelessly without fail and
demonstrates what can be accomplished

119
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,840
if we set our mind and energy to a task.

120
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,860
This might be the most significant difference between the Yu myths and other floods.

121
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,900
Noah and Utanapishtim make for, relatively,
shallow role models.

122
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,840
Sure they follow God's instructions, but they're not always the epitome of virtue.

123
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,140
Noah even hits the bottle after
inventing vineyards post─flood.

124
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,740
Yu, on the other hand,
is meant to be read as a pristine model.

125
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:28,560
In terms of a myth providing guidance
for how to live and especially, how to rule,

126
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,360
it doesn't get much better than Yu, his helpful dragon friend and his legendarily patient wife.

127
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,760
Thanks for watching,

128
00:08:35,760 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll see you next week.
