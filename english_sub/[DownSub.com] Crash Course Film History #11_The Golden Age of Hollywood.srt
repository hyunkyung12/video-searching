1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,930
When I say Hollywood, you probably think of
big-budget movies, star-studded premieres,

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,180
and studios with giant backlots pumping out
film after film.

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,280
Most of those associations really began sometime
between the 1920s and the 1950s.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,770
Once audiences could hear actors speak, listen
to pre-recorded musical scores, and enjoy

5
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:21,510
sound effects, film cemented its place as
the main medium for mass communication, art,

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:22,510
and commerce.

7
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,740
And as important as Hollywood was during the
Silent Era, nobody could compete after the

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,740
arrival of sound.

9
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,980
New major film studios emerged, each with
their own style and favorite celebrities:

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,460
before George Clooney and Jennifer Lawrence,
there was Clark Gable and Janet Leigh.

11
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,210
This cascade of films led to more technological
innovations, too, like color film and the

12
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,239
widescreen formats we still use today.

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,179
This was the Golden Age of Hollywood.

14
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,560
[singing] Hollywooood ba-ba-da-ba-d– OK,
I’ll stop.

15
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:58,660
[Opening Music Plays]

16
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:03,350
After the Stock Market Crash in October of
1929, most parts of the American economy took

17
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,349
a real hit.

18
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:05,349
But not Hollywood.

19
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:08,880
And at the height of the Great Depression
in 1933, roughly a quarter of the American

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,310
workforce couldn’t find a job, and millions
of others were barely making ends meet.

21
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,960
So you’d think that the last thing people
would do with their hard-earned money was

22
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,960
go to the movies.

23
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,229
And yet, the Depression was one of the best
things to happen to the American film business.

24
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:20,250
That’s depressing...

25
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,829
In fact, more films were released by the major
studios during the 1920s and ‘30s than any

26
00:01:23,829 --> 00:01:27,799
other decade – averaging about 800 a year,
compared to less than 500 per year today.

27
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:30,890
It was cheaper to go to the movies than a
play or a concert, and cinema became a means

28
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:31,890
of escape.

29
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,719
As we’ve talked about, films are an illusion
of reality.

30
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:37,140
And that illusion was super attractive to
people whose day-to-day reality was often

31
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,140
pretty bleak.

32
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,460
Genre films became more popular – things
like gangster films, musicals, westerns, and

33
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,460
screwball comedies.

34
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,450
Anything to take people’s mind off their
own struggles and celebrate good old American

35
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,939
values of optimism, resilience, ambition,
and courage.

36
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:52,070
At the height of Hollywood’s Golden Age,
five film studios ruled the town.

37
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,460
All five were vertically-integrated, just
like the major studios of the Silent Era.

38
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:59,009
They each had their own distinct reputations
and focused on different kinds of films.

39
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:02,600
First up, we have Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer – or
MGM – which was the biggest studio in the

40
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,600
1930s.

41
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,969
Louis B. Mayer ran MGM with his business partner,
Irving Thalberg.

42
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:10,460
Mayer was the savvy businessman of the two;
he approved the budgets and oversaw the distribution

43
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,460
and marketing.

44
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,690
Thalberg, on the other hand, was a former
producer, and the mind behind the stories

45
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:14,690
and actual production.

46
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:18,890
Together, they made slick, big-budget musicals,
comedies, melodramas, and literary adaptations

47
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,820
– sparing no expense on sets, costumes,
extras, and the biggest movie stars.

48
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,950
Think of The Wizard of Oz, Gone with the Wind,
and Mutiny on the Bounty.

49
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,750
I’m talking opulence, people!

50
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,730
Next is Paramount Pictures, which was known
as the most “European” studio, because

51
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:33,190
they lured a lot of filmmakers away from Germany
and the U.K.

52
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,190
They also gave these filmmakers more leeway
to put their own stamp on movies – hits

53
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,780
like Shanghai Express, The Sign of the Cross,
and Morocco.

54
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,170
Our third player, Warner Brothers, branded
itself as the studio of the working class.

55
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,690
They churned out low-budget melodramas, gritty
gangster movies like The Public Enemy with

56
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,660
James Cagney, and musicals set in the Depression
like Footlight Parade, with James Cagney.

57
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,660
The fourth major studio was 20th Century-Fox,
which made its reputation thanks to its chief

58
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,580
director and its most profitable star, not
James Cagney

59
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,670
That director was John Ford, who won back-to-back
best director Oscars for The Grapes of Wrath

60
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:04,430
and How Green Was My Valley, while Shirley
Temple sang and danced her way through a string

61
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,430
of wholesome hits.

62
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,910
And lastly, RKO was the home of the extremely
popular Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musicals.

63
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,420
Can I do a dance number Nick?

64
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,420
Nick: Nope.

65
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,980
RKO also took a lot of chances, producing
everything from Howard Hawks’ screwball

66
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:20,480
comedy Bringing Up Baby, to the 1933 version
of King Kong, and one of the most influential

67
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,910
films of all time, Citizen Kane.

68
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:23,910
Never heard of it.

69
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,720
Now, all five of these studios dominated the
production, distribution, and exhibition of

70
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,970
films – for a while.

71
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:31,840
But a U.S. Supreme Court Case in 1948, along
with the coming of television, signaled a

72
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,890
major turning point.

73
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:36,410
In the case, known as United States versus
Paramount Pictures, the government argued

74
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,230
that the major studios were in violation of
antitrust laws.

75
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,440
In other words, by owning both the production
studios and the movie theaters, they were

76
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,330
exercising an unfair monopoly and stifling
competition.

77
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:49,430
The Supreme Court agreed, and forced the studios
to break up their businesses, sell their theaters,

78
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,830
and focus on just production and distribution.

79
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:55,300
Hollywood continued to lead the global film
market for another 10 or 15 years, but that

80
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,610
near-complete control over the industry was
ending.

81
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,180
We’ll talk a lot more about this next time.

82
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,300
Now, the Golden Age of Hollywood saw some
major technical leaps in the film business,

83
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,120
too, including: color.

84
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,680
Filmmakers had been experimenting with color
since the dawn of cinema.

85
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,620
The earliest techniques involved hand-tinting
individual frames, a painstaking process that

86
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,550
had to be repeated for each print of each
film.

87
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,550
Not great.

88
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:19,620
Over the next few decades, engineers found
ways to use stencils to tint films much faster.

89
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,730
They also developed other means of adding
color, like bathing the film stock in dyes

90
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:27,100
that fit the mood of the scene, called toning
– red for violence, blue for sorrow, green

91
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,100
for...grassy.

92
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,710
By the mid-1920s, nearly 90 percent of Hollywood
films were either tinted, toned, or some combination

93
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,710
of the two.

94
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,220
Which was great, except the color itself looked
wildly artificial.

95
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,460
And once Hollywood converted to sound-on-film
technology, the tinting interfered with the

96
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,760
film stock’s ability to record proper sound.

97
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,260
Crash Course Film History, tl;dr: it’s hard.

98
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,140
So filmmakers needed to figure out color cinematography
– capturing color with the image.

99
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:52,790
As early as 1861, a Scottish physicist named
James Clerk Maxwell – who we talked about

100
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:56,180
in Crash Course Physics (well, I didn’t,
Shini did) – built the foundations of color

101
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,180
photography.

102
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,150
The light all around us is made up of a spectrum
of different wavelengths, some of which we

103
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,460
see as visible colors.

104
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,940
Knowing this, Maxwell figured out that all
those colors can be derived from some combination

105
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,910
of red, yellow, and blue.

106
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:11,280
Beginning in 1906, artists and engineers tried
for 15 years to use this knowledge to achieve

107
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,450
color cinematography.

108
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,190
But, much like me in high school, they kept
failing.

109
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,300
Their experiments were unreliable or too expensive.

110
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,210
Then along came Technicolor.

111
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:23,740
In 1922, the Technicolor Corporation saw its
first success with a special beam-splitting

112
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,889
camera that could make two separate negatives.

113
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:29,280
The light entered the camera and was split
into different wavelengths, just like how

114
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,639
sunlight hits a prism and splits into a rainbow.

115
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:35,260
Half continued straight ahead, while the other
half was diverted 90 degrees, to produce two

116
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,380
film negatives.

117
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,520
These negatives were chemically treated, dyed
either blue or red, and cemented together.

118
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,210
Then you could run that final film strip through
a regular projector, and voilà!

119
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,300
Even though they weren’t spot-on, the colors
in these films were more reliable and accurate

120
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,770
than any of the earlier attempts.

121
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,790
And while that beam-splitting camera was expensive,
at least theaters didn’t have to buy new

122
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,530
projectors to show color films.

123
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,050
Over the next decade, Technicolor expanded
its system into a three-color process, with

124
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,540
a camera that recorded the original image
onto three separate negatives – red, blue,

125
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,540
and green.

126
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:04,200
And by 1932, this process created such high-quality,
vibrant results, that Technicolor ended up

127
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,010
with a virtual monopoly on color film for
the next 20 years.

128
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,390
Throughout the 1930s, filmmakers and studios
gradually began playing around with Technicolor.

129
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:13,680
By the middle of the decade, producer David
O. Selznick turned a corner by casting big

130
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,690
stars in color films for the first time.

131
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:19,530
And as the 1930s came to a close, Hollywood
released a series of high-profile hits that

132
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,110
proved color was here to stay.

133
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,310
These films that used Technicolor ranged from
the Errol Flynn swashbuckler The Adventures

134
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:28,230
of Robin Hood, to classics like The Wizard
of Oz and Gone with the Wind, and even animated

135
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,650
features like Disney’s Snow White and Pinnochio.

136
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,990
Advances in color cinematography would continue
to develop over the years, but the basics

137
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,290
stayed the same until film stock gave way
to digital video in the 21st century.

138
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:41,040
Now, a third technical element of cinema was
standardized during the Golden Age of Hollywood.

139
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,900
It’s something called aspect ratio – that’s
the ratio of the movie screen’s width to

140
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,900
its height.

141
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,910
Back in 1932, the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences – the folks who give out

142
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:53,420
the Oscars – established a standard aspect
ratio of 4:3, which looks like this.

143
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,650
Also known as the Academy aperture, this ratio
isn’t a square, but it’s closer to one

144
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,860
than we’re used to these days.

145
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,741
That’s because most movies we see today
are shot in an aspect ratio of 16:9, which

146
00:07:01,741 --> 00:07:03,090
looks like this.

147
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,450
That’s more like it!

148
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,650
We often call this widescreen.

149
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:09,361
And so much film and TV is shot at this ratio
that most new screens are built to fit it.

150
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:11,449
But those are just two possible aspect ratios.

151
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:15,760
Back in the 1950s, some filmmakers experimented
with an extreme widescreen ratio called Cinerama.

152
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,120
This process involved shooting a film with
three separate synchronized cameras hooked

153
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,840
together in an arc, and projecting it from
three synchronized projectors.

154
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,840
Weird.

155
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,860
The screen was shaped in a similar arc, kind
of wrapping itself around the audience.

156
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,710
Y’know, for a real immersive experience.

157
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:32,930
And the final aspect ratio of Cinerama was
about 8:3, which looks like this.

158
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:36,600
The most famous film shot in Cinerama was
the western epic How the West Was Won.

159
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,570
But, as you can probably guess, this process
was too expensive and complicated to achieve

160
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,570
widespread use.

161
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,480
And it was bad for performer’s necks.

162
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,710
On the heels of Cinerama came CinemaScope.

163
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:49,490
Rather than shooting with multiple cameras,
CinemaScope utilized something called an anamorphic

164
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,490
lens.

165
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,710
This was a special lens for cameras that recorded
a wider image, but squeezed it laterally so

166
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,460
that everything would fit onto standard 35mm
film stock.

167
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,860
When the film was projected, a similar lens
attached to the projector would “unsqueeze”

168
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,750
the image, expanding it back out, and projecting
it up onto the screen.

169
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,140
The result was an impressive 2.55:1 aspect
ratio.

170
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:09,760
Audiences got their first taste of it in the
1953 biblical epic The Robe.

171
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,830
And by the end of that year, every major Hollywood
studio except Paramount was licensed to make

172
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,949
CinemaScope films.

173
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:19,460
Over time, the ratio was reduced to 2.35:1,
and in the mid-1950s, the American film industry

174
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,410
had almost entirely converted to shooting
anamorphic widescreen films.

175
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,080
It took some time for filmmakers to adjust
to widescreen shooting.

176
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,080
When you move from an aspect ratio of 4:3
to 16:9, that’s a whole lotta extra room

177
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,080
to fill.

178
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,080
So what do you do with it?

179
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,320
Well, we fill it with, like, knick knacks
and stuff.

180
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,059
Close-ups, especially of faces, became difficult
to frame, while landscapes got easier.

181
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:40,918
At first, widescreen films rewarded composition
and long takes over editing.

182
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:44,259
Filmmakers built their stories by filling
the frame, rather than cutting to new images.

183
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:47,649
Genres like the western, the musical, and
large-scale epics all lent themselves to these

184
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:49,300
kinds of world-building possibilities.

185
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:53,170
In the end, the technical advancements of
sound, color, and an aspect ratio that could

186
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:57,140
surround the audience made the powerful Hollywood
studios the center of the cinematic universe

187
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,360
from the late 1920s to the late 1950s.

188
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,509
It was a Golden Age whose echoes are felt
in our films today.

189
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:05,779
Today we learned about how the the American
studio system took advantage of sound film

190
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,930
and the Great Depression to achieve global
dominance.

191
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:11,760
We discussed the development of color cinematography
and what it meant for filmmakers and film

192
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,019
audiences.

193
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:17,029
And we examined aspect ratio, and how the
move to widescreen cinema affected films being

194
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:18,029
made.

195
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:20,860
Next time, we’ll learn about how filmmakers
in Europe and the United States reacted against

196
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,970
the formulaic movies coming out of Hollywood
and created a new wave of gritty, irreverent,

197
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,120
and innovative cinema.

198
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,779
Crash Course Film History is produced in association
with PBS Digital Studios.
