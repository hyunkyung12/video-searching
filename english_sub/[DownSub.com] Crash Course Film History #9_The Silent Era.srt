1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,810
Hollywood, here we come!

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:05,810
The glamor!

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:06,810
The celebrities!

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,810
The scandals!

5
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,780
I’m not talking about Bennifer or Brangelina.

6
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,100
Craig: Are they still things?
Nick: No...
Craig: I'm kind of out of touch.

7
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,740
But I'm not out of touch with the Golden Age of Silent
Cinema, when stars rose and fell, studios

8
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:22,100
perfected the mass production of films, and
American movies dominated the global film market.

9
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,900
In some ways, it was very different from the
Hollywood we know today.

10
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,500
Movie studios wielded enormous power.

11
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,539
They kept stars and directors under tight
control.

12
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:29,880
The movies they made were silent.

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,980
And a ticket would set you back a whopping
10 or 25 cents.

14
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,820
On the other hand, a lot of the patterns set
during this time still seem awfully familiar today.

15
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,720
Studios marketed films on the power of their
stars.

16
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,829
Genres like gangster movies and romantic comedies
took hold and flourished.

17
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:44,679
And audiences craved gossip about the private
lives of celebrities.

18
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,789
To understand the world as it is, sometimes
you have to go back to where it all began.

19
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:50,080
And for Hollywood, that’s the Silent Era.

20
00:00:50,080 --> 00:01:03,080
[Opening Music Plays]

21
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,739
Film was going in a lot of different directions

22
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,000
after the First World War.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,340
In Germany, filmmakers drew on the Expressionist
movement to manipulate their film’s mise-en-scene,

24
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,870
creating groundbreaking horror films.

25
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:15,390
In Russia, Soviet filmmakers were using cinema
to perfect the arts of propaganda through

26
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,799
revolutionary editing techniques.

27
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,009
And in the US, the Hollywood studio system
was positioning itself to dominate the rest

28
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:22,009
of the world.

29
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:25,759
Within film studios, the entire filmmaking
process took place – from conceiving, writing,

30
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,820
and shooting the films, to marketing and distribution.

31
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,590
The studios had chosen California for its
film-friendly sunny weather, its proximity

32
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,270
to all kinds of terrain, and ... its distance
from Thomas Edison, who spent much of the

33
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,890
1910s fighting for control of the American
film industry from his base in New Jersey.

34
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,659
In the early days of the Silent Era, three
film studios ruled them all: the Famous Players-Lasky

35
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:46,969
Corporation, which would eventually become
Paramount Pictures – Loew’s Inc., which

36
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:49,649
began as a theater chain – and First National
Pictures.

37
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:53,469
Not only did these three dominate the marketplace,
they exercised near complete control over

38
00:01:53,469 --> 00:01:56,799
the creative and personal lives of their stars,
writers, and directors.

39
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,460
Filmmakers often had to choose between following
the studio’s orders or abandoning their careers.

40
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:04,179
Then, four of the most powerful figures in
early silent cinema came together to create

41
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:05,609
their own film studio.

42
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:08,100
In 1919, two directors – Charlie Chaplin
and D.W. Griffith -

43
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,840
and two stars -- Douglas Fairbanks
and Mary Pickford – founded United Artists.

44
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,010
Their goal was to give filmmakers more control
over their films and a greater percentage

45
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,080
of the profits.

46
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,340
CHA-CHING! Is what I assume they would say.

47
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,670
Of course, not many filmmakers could afford
to go out on their own like that, so the contract

48
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,640
system would continue for several more decades.

49
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,890
In 1924, the most powerful studio emerged
when Loew’s purchased Goldwyn Pictures and

50
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:32,100
Louis B. Mayer Productions to create Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, better known as MGM.

51
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,100
Which lead to MGM studios which lead to Tower of Terror,

52
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,980
and have you been on Tower of Terror? That's a pretty fun time.

53
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,860
This is a process that would get repeated
throughout the 1920s and 1930s, as studios

54
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,000
merged or sold or split apart.

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,480
Probably because of prohibition and they didn't have anything else to do.

56
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,870
By the end of the era, most American films
were being made at studios whose names you

57
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:52,120
might recognize from the multiplex today:
not only United Artists and MGM, but also

58
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,980
Warner Brothers, Fox, Universal, and Columbia
Pictures.

59
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,040
Now while the corporate structure of these
companies kept changing, the process by which

60
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,310
they were making films was becoming remarkably
stable and efficient. Unlike me.

61
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,860
The major studios became very good at churning

62
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,300
out large-scale, commercial movies with mass
appeal.

63
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,420
One of the leading innovators in setting up
the way studios worked was a man named Thomas H. Ince.

64
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,400
Like D.W. Griffith, Ince came to film as a failed actor.

65
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,410
He directed his first film in 1910, and by
1913 he was making as many as 150 two-reelers

66
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,410
a year!

67
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:22,590
His biggest impact on film came by applying
the lessons of mass production to the actual

68
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,640
making of movies.

69
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,250
Prior to Ince, most films were overseen by
a director-cameraman – a single person who

70
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,040
conceived the story, worked with the actors,
and operated the camera.

71
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,220
Ince broke those roles into separate jobs:

72
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,040
A screenwriter to conceive the story and write the script.

73
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,620
A director to make creative decisions on set
and work with the actors.

74
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,180
An editor to assemble the footage.

75
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,110
A producer to supervise the project from inception
to final cut.

76
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,400
And a studio head to oversee the entire studio.

77
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,480
While other filmmakers had played around with
these roles, it was Ince who standardized

78
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,760
them into a system – a system still used
today.

79
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,290
By 1912, he’d earned enough money to buy
a ranch west of Hollywood where he built his

80
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,980
own studio, a place he called Inceville…

81
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,060
Yep!

82
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,920
It was here where the first permanent exterior
sets were built, made to resemble far flung

83
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,520
locations, like a cowboy saloon, a little
Swiss street, or a Japanese village.

84
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,730
And as Ince worked to define the roles and
streamline the means of production, he was

85
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,570
able to triple the output of his studio.

86
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:14,250
Though he died quite young in 1924, Ince’s
impact on film production was as thorough,

87
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,250
widespread, and lasting.

88
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,970
Now, Mack Sennett, another early film mogul
and one-time partner of Ince, was responsible

89
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,710
for discovering a whole slew of film legends,
whose names you might recognize.

90
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,980
People like the Keystone Cops, Fatty Arbuckle,
Gloria Swanson, Carole Lombard, W.C.

91
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,100
Fields, and… the great Charlie Chaplin.

92
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,740
Let's talk a little bit about Charlie Chaplin.

93
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,280
He was born into poverty in England
in 1889.

94
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,700
He went into acting, signed with a prestigious
Vaudeville touring company, and set off for

95
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,180
America at age 19.

96
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,340
A film talent scout spotted him there, got
him hired by Sennett, and the rest is history.

97
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,340
That we're gonna talk about because we're talking about Film History.

98
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:48,500
Smart, curious, and driven, it didn’t take
long for Chaplin to develop his iconic Tramp

99
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,500
persona and begin directing his own films.

100
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,181
After finishing his first film contract, Chaplin
struck an extremely lucrative deal with the

101
00:04:54,181 --> 00:04:57,220
Chicago-based Essanay Studios to make 14 short
films.

102
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,720
While at Essanay, he found ways to combine
his finely tuned sense of empathy and his

103
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,280
recognizable Tramp character with a growing
ability to make audiences laugh – through

104
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,710
both physical comedy and increasingly clever
storylines.

105
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:11,210
In fact, he was so popular that by the time
his Essanay contract was up in 1915, he negotiated

106
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,540
an almost unprecedented salary of $10,000
per week with another studio, the Mutual

107
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,540
Film Corporation.

108
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:22,360
They also paid him a signing bonus of $150,000
– the equivalent of about $3.5 million today.

109
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,360
CHA-CHING! Is what they would have said at the time.

110
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,340
The movies Chaplin made with Mutual brought
him international stardom.

111
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,860
They marked the first time his focus on the
poor verged into social criticism, a place

112
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,300
silent comedies rarely, if ever, went.

113
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,260
True to his roots – and despite being one
of the highest paid people in the world – Chaplin’s

114
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,560
films often focused on the gentle, accidental
heroism of the downtrodden.

115
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,639
Time and again, he made the powerful the butt
of his jokes and displayed tremendous empathy

116
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,930
for the poor and the humble.

117
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:48,670
Then in 1919, at age 30, he co-founded United
Artists in an effort to exercise greater control

118
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,580
over his films.

119
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,400
I'm 36... I better get moving.

120
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,060
What followed was a string of classic movies
that rank not only among Chaplin’s best,

121
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,730
but among the best film comedies of all time:
The Kid – his first feature film and a smash

122
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:03,700
hit – The Gold Rush, City Lights, Modern
Times, and his controversial take-down of

123
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,440
Adolf Hitler, The Great Dictator.

124
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,800
His later career would be hampered by legal
problems and socialist sympathies, which would

125
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,880
land him on the infamous post-war blacklist,
and keep him from making films.

126
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,290
But at his height, no one benefited more from
the Silent Era studio system than Charlie

127
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:18,860
Chaplin – as a director, making a lot of
films quickly and efficiently; and as an actor,

128
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,639
commanding enormous salaries and unheard-of
creative control.

129
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:24,419
And he wasn’t the only one to turn this
system to his advantage.

130
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:27,340
Actor-directors like Buster Keaton, “Fatty”
Arbuckle, and Harold Lloyd achieved great

131
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,860
success making their own short and feature-length
comedies.

132
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:34,100
Stars from Mary Pickford to Gloria Swanson
parlayed their celebrity into tangible behind-the-scenes power.

133
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,100
Now, as film became more and more central
to popular culture, some people started to

134
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,100
get nervous.

135
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,590
They worried that movies posed a real threat
to public morality.

136
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,880
They saw films promoting materialism, cynicism,
sexual license.

137
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,700
This would be a debate that would
come up again and again in American culture

138
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,660
– about movies or music or video games.

139
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,580
Until now when we've solved all those problems.

140
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,600
Is the medium causing society’s problems,

141
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:53,610
or just reflecting them?

142
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:57,131
A few real-life Hollywood scandals at the
time tipped the scales, bringing on the first

143
00:06:57,131 --> 00:06:59,280
real self-censorship of American cinema.

144
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,220
The gossip press fed readers stories about
stars dealing with addictions, affairs, and worse.

145
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,760
The most famous of these centered around Fatty
Arbuckle, who was accused of the rape and

146
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,170
accidental death of an actress named Virginia
Rappe.

147
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:12,650
Although he was ultimately acquitted after
three highly-publicized trials, the scandal

148
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:16,030
itself all but ended Arbuckle’s career,
and left an opening for a government crackdown

149
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,270
on immorality in films and the film business.

150
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,220
Rather than wait for Congress to get involved,
the major players in the film industry banded

151
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:25,530
together to form the MPPDA – the Motion
Picture Producers and Distributors of America.

152
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:29,510
They hired a retired Postmaster General named
Will Hays, a conservative Evangelical, to

153
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,440
prove they were serious about cleaning up
their act.

154
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,370
And that’s exactly what Hays did in 1930,
putting together the Motion Picture Production

155
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:40,060
Code, also known as the Hays Code, a catalogue
of things filmmakers could and couldn’t show on screen.

156
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:40,940
...fun.

157
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,060
The Code also suggested a strategy called
Compensating Values.

158
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:47,479
The idea was that films could show characters
engaging in vice for most of the film, as

159
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:49,430
long as virtue triumphed in the end.

160
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,229
No one employed this technique better than
director Cecile B. DeMille.

161
00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:55,620
He was a master at giving the audience all
the vice and excess they could handle for

162
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,470
the first three quarters of the movie, before
virtue came out on top.

163
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,710
Other filmmakers found their own ways around
the Hays Code.

164
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,949
German director Ernst Lubitsch came to Hollywood
in 1922 and made a successful series of witty

165
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:08,570
sex comedies that relied on suggestion and
innuendo rather than skin.

166
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:12,290
For many of these filmmakers, however, the
Hays Code was about to become the least of

167
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,290
their worries.

168
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:17,190
A seismic event was poised to shake up Hollywood,
and not every filmmaker of the Silent Era

169
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,800
was going to come out the other side with
their career intact.

170
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,920
The world was about to get its first taste
of synchronous sound.

171
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,860
And it tasted good... maybe, I don't know.

172
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,240
Today, we explored the Silent Era, the first
golden age of Hollywood filmmaking.

173
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:34,450
We learned about the innovations of Thomas
Ince and the rise of the American film studio.

174
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:37,729
And we discussed some of the most important
Silent Era filmmakers and how their scandals

175
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:41,110
– both real and imagined – led Hollywood
to institute industry standards governing

176
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,279
the content of their films.

177
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:46,350
Next we’ll tackle the biggest shift in the
history of film yet, as movies find their

178
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,899
voice... es...

179
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:51,490
Crash Course Film History is produced in association
with PBS Digital Studios.

180

182
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,389

the Doctor Cheryl C. Kinney Studio with the

183
