1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,960
There are movies about war.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,299
And there are movies about kids.

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,820
But the movies about war starring kids are
more rare.

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,530
Some are science fiction, like 2013’s Ender’s
Game.

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,369
Others follow children trying to survive during
wartime, movies like Stephen Spielberg’s

6
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:18,720
Empire of the Sun starring a young Christian Bale.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,650
Or John Boorman’s semi-autobiographical
Hope and Glory about growing up in London

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:23,650
during the Blitz.

9
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:27,830
But even fewer films are about children
who actually participate in war, like a

10
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,150
2015 movie that tackled the real-life issue
of child soldiers.

11
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:35,480
From its gritty, handheld camerawork, to its
charismatic leading performances, this grueling

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,539
drama is a masterclass in intensely vibrant
and subjective cinema.

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,420
Let’s dig into Beasts of No Nation.

14
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:54,840
[Intro Music]

15
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,280
Beasts of No Nation was a dream project for

16
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,730
writer-director Cary Fukunaga.

17
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:03,069
He was fresh off two acclaimed features – 2009’s
Sin Nombre

18
00:01:03,069 --> 00:01:05,600
and the 2011 big screen adaptation of Jane
Eyre –

19
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,450
as well as his stunning direction of the first
season of True Detective.

20
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:12,820
So Fukunaga was able to cobble together a
tiny budget and haul a crew into the jungles

21
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,009
of Ghana to do the near impossible.

22
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:19,219
Based on the 2005 novel by Nigerian-American
author Uzodinma Iweala

23
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,980
Beasts of No Nation takes place in a fictional,
nameless, African country torn apart by civil war.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,020
Various rebel factions battle the military
and each other for control of the nation,

25
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,570
wreaking havoc, slaughtering civilians, and
leaving behind a wake of misery.

26
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:37,120
The story follows a young boy named Agu, played
with incredible focus by Ghanaian actor Abraham Attah.

27
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,840
Agu lives with his family in what’s called
the “buffer zone,” a protected safe haven

28
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,430
guarded by the United Nations.

29
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:46,189
His life isn’t easy, but he’s sheltered
from the worst parts of the conflict and allowed

30
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,470
to maintain a pretty recognizable childhood.

31
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:52,360
He plays with friends, jokes with his older
brother, and does chores for his family.

32
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:57,009
That all changes when the government falls
and the war comes to his doorstep.

33
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:00,979
Almost overnight, Agu’s family is split
apart and his father and older brother are

34
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:02,290
shot in front of his eyes.

35
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:06,630
Agu barely escapes into the vast jungle, where
he’s captured by a battalion of the National

36
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,960
Defense Forces.

37
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,640
The NDF is a ragtag rebel group made up of
young men and boys, led by a brutal, charismatic

38
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,420
man they call the Commandant

39
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,420
The Commandant: What is this thing doing here?

40
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,540
The Commandant: Who is responsible for 
 bringing this thing?

41
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,200
In a searing performance, Idris Elba inhabits

42
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,920
the role of the barbaric, yet fatherly leader
who specializes in indoctrinating child soldiers.

43
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,480
The Commandant: Now what are they calling you?

44
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,440
Agu: Agu...

45
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,440
The Commandant: Oh, you must say it like you are prouder.

46
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,300
Agu: Agu.

47
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,320
The Commandant: One more time.

48
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,540
Agu: Agu!

49
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,080
The Commandant: Well, Agu. That is what I'll be calling you, then.

50
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,660
Under the Commandant’s direction, Agu endures
an initiation process that includes killing

51
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,840
a captive man with a machete.

52
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,730
And he’s forced to submit to the Commandant’s
predatory sexual assault.

53
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:02,840
From there, Agu and his fellow NDF soldiers
follow the Commandant across the country,

54
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,060
causing destruction and taking over towns,
until they’re called to the rebel capital

55
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,840
and the Commandant is demoted.

56
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,420
This begins a downward slide that ends with
most of the child soldiers dead and the rest

57
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,490
abandoning the Commandant after he and Agu
hold each other at gunpoint.

58
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:21,650
Rescued by UN peacekeepers, Agu and the other
children wind up in a coastal rehabilitation

59
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:26,670
school, struggling to recognize their own
humanity and recover some sliver of their

60
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,670
childhood.

61
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:31,480
It’s an incredibly harrowing story, filled
with both darkness and violence.

62
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,760
And Fukunaga’s skill with the language of
cinema makes it a mesmerizing film.

63
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,420
From the opening shot, Fukunaga makes a nod
to the fact that what we’re watching is

64
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,420
an illusion.

65
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,550
That no matter how hard it may be to watch,
it pales in comparison to real life.

66
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,150
The film opens with a shot of young African
boys playing soccer in a field.

67
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,310
The camera pulls back through an empty television
set.

68
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,640
And that TV re-frames the game, presenting
it as if it’s happening on a screen.

69
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,990
Just like the film we’re watching!

70
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:01,860
This device, the empty TV set, then becomes
an instrument of the plot used to reveal character.

71
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,450
Agu and his buddies try to sell it as “imagination
TV.”

72
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:09,020
They set it up for the local guards and act
out various shows on the other side.

73
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:13,480
It sets Agu up as resourceful, bright, and
funny – all qualities that will be tested

74
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,870
by the trials of the story to come.

75
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,079
Writer-director Fukunaga, who also acts as
his own cinematographer, uses all the tools

76
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,170
of cinema to put us in the perspective of
his young protagonist.

77
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,960
Many of the shots, especially early in the
film, are framed from low angles.

78
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,870
Agu looks up to his father, his older brother,
and eventually to the Commandant.

79
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,870
And so do we.

80
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:35,570
The opening scenes have a vaguely gauzy look,
presenting much of Agu’s home life like

81
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:39,240
a traditional coming-of-age drama – from
the pranks with his brother and the family

82
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,160
dinner, to a celebratory church service.

83
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,480
The film is patient with these scenes.

84
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,130
Fukunaga and his editors, Pete Beaudreau and
Mikkel E.G. Nielsen, give us time to explore

85
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:51,580
Agu’s life, his community, and his deep
connections to his family.

86
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:56,210
Just like Agu, we’re lulled into a false
sense of security by the look, feel, and pacing

87
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,550
of these early scenes.

88
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,700
But that’s all about to change.

89
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:04,350
Once the war decimates the village, Fukunaga
turns to much more brutal, jarring, and unpredictable

90
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:08,000
techniques to tell the story, which perfectly
mirrors Agu’s experience.

91
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,960
The cinematography style becomes more aggressively
handheld, capturing the chaos of the violence.

92
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,650
The editing becomes faster too, as Agu first
encounters the shock of war.

93
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,220
Through it all, Fukunaga keeps the focus on
Agu and his point of view.

94
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,220
We get close-up after close-up of the boy’s
face, followed by shots of what he’s looking at.

95
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,800
This classic example of the Kuleshov effect
keeps us tracking his emotions, even as the

96
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,070
camera becomes more frenzied.

97
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,070
But that’s not the only trick up Fukunaga’s
sleeve.

98
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:37,250
He uses extreme wide shots to help us dive
into Agu’s perspective too.

99
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:41,150
Once Agu escapes from the village and finds
himself deep in the jungle, Fukunaga frames

100
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,870
him in extremely wide shots.

101
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:48,889
This presents Agu as a tiny dot in a vast,
dangerous world, emphasizing his insignificance

102
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:50,040
and vulnerability.

103
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,370
His life has been wrenched out of the comfort
of a community and a home, and suddenly becomes

104
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,130
extremely precarious.

105
00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:00,570
Most of the middle of the film is shot in
a realist style, with natural lighting, handheld

106
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:05,320
camerawork, and diegetic sound, or sound whose
source exists within the world of the film.

107
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,700
And the effect of this realist style is one
of immediacy – we feel the intensity of

108
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,380
each second along with Agu.

109
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,520
As he’s captured by the NDF troops, comes
face to face with the Commandant, and becomes

110
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,340
one of many child soldiers, he’s forced
to live in the moment.

111
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,500
And the moment is often unfamiliar and terrifying.

112
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,070
Violence, or the threat of violence, fills
every scene and lurks after each pan or cut.

113
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,300
And we are right there with him.

114
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:34,060
Occasionally, though, Fukunaga breaks this
realism to illustrate a big emotional turning point.

115
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,111
One instance of this comes after the rebels
take down a convoy of military trucks, and

116
00:06:38,111 --> 00:06:41,010
the Commandant decides to complete Agu’s
initiation ritual.

117
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:44,740
Agu, who’s been carrying ammunition for
the troops, is called over.

118
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,270
And the Commandant orders him to take the
life of the last remaining enemy.

119
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:51,950
The man is bound, on his knees, begging for
his life.

120
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:56,080
The Commandant gives Agu a machete and talks
about how hard he’ll have to swing it to

121
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,270
split the man’s head open.

122
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:03,060
Fukunaga extends the moment, drawing out the
suspense, as the Commandant urges Agu on and

123
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,980
the other soldiers watch in silence.

124
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,850
The film cuts back and forth between increasingly
zoomed-in close-ups of Agu, and a medium close-up

125
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,130
of the captured soldier.

126
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:15,630
When Agu finally swings his machete, the film
goes quiet for a split second.

127
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:19,710
Then one of Agu’s fellow child soldiers,
a boy named Strika, steps forward.

128
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:23,510
He swings his own machete, and joins Agu as
they chop the man to death.

129
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:28,040
At this point, the film moves into slow motion,
and Fukunaga cuts out most of the diegetic

130
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,530
sound, replacing it with an echoey, low rumble.

131
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:34,830
This droning sound crescendos as Agu swings
his machete.

132
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:38,670
The camera keeps the boys in frame, with the
Commandant in the background, focusing on

133
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:42,070
their expressionless faces, rather than the
gore at their feet.

134
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:46,740
This whole sequence has the effect of drawing
us into Agu’s intense personal decision.

135
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,410
It helps us feel how he’s dissociating
from the violent act to preserve his sanity.

136
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:55,729
Fukunaga uses this heightened reality to let
us absorb the brutality of Agu’s actions

137
00:07:55,729 --> 00:07:58,220
and understand their emotional significance.

138
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,440
And Fukunaga takes a different approach to
a very similar moment later in the film.

139
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,440
When the rebels seize control of an enemy
city, Agu and a small group of child soldiers

140
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,310
are clearing a building when they discover
a woman and her two small children hiding

141
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,310
in a wardrobe.

142
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:15,919
Beaten down by the violence he’s been forced
to both witness and commit, Agu mistakes

143
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,160
the woman for his mother, cries out, and clings
to her.

144
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,860
When he discovers his mistake, he reels, crossing
into the next room where Strika is beating

145
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,520
one of the captured children.

146
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,240
And then he turns back into the main room
and shoots the woman.

147
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,040
It’s an intense, psychologically fraught
sequence.

148
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:35,380
Agu’s reality warps and he responds with
the tool he’s been taught to use over and

149
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,568
over again: an act of violence.

150
00:08:37,568 --> 00:08:42,148
But rather than film it in a traditional way,
by cutting up the sequence, Fukunaga chooses

151
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:46,290
to trap us in the moment with Agu by making
it a continuous steadicam shot.

152
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:51,029
The camera tracks Agu through the entire scene,
in and out of the rooms, as he begins to crack

153
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:54,850
under the pressure that’s been building
up since his own village was destroyed.

154
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:58,670
And because the shot never cuts, we feel
trapped too.

155
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,699
Just like him, we’re unable to look away
from the horrors of war, with its many different

156
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:04,209
forms of violence.

157
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:08,630
Another thing to consider when analyzing Beasts
of No Nation is the score by Dan Romer.

158
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:12,339
Much like another war movie we discussed,
Apocalypse Now, there are times when the score

159
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,760
starts to feel like something from a science
fiction film.

160
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,880
It’s subtle, but powerful in making scenes
and shots feel otherworldly, like Agu is lost

161
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,480
and far away from home.

162
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,519
Like this isn’t even his version of Earth.

163
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,249
It can make us feel like we’re seeing a
parallel version of Agu – like we’re

164
00:09:49,249 --> 00:09:51,209
seeing an alternate, dark timeline.

165
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:55,240
And in fact, while the film draws heavily
on real-life experiences of child soldiers,

166
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,290
it’s deliberately set in an unnamed, fictional
African country.

167
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,959
So in a way, this actually is another world!

168
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:06,269
The film takes on a new language in the final
scenes, too, once Agu has freed himself from

169
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:08,429
the Commandant and been rescued by the UN
troops.

170
00:10:08,429 --> 00:10:12,399
At the coastal rehabilitation school, the
filming style settles down.

171
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,279
Fukunaga uses much less handheld camerawork,
and the shots last longer.

172
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:19,670
Stylistically, the film becomes more stable,
just like Agu’s world.

173
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:24,990
He has fresh clothes, plenty of food, an education,
and no one pushing him to fight or kill.

174
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:29,209
And yet, he spends time apart from others,
watching the other former child soldiers running

175
00:10:29,209 --> 00:10:31,420
into the surf and horse-playing on the beach.

176
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:35,649
In one devastating scene, an aid worker questions
Agu about his experiences.

177
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:38,950
She wants him to begin to articulate what
happened in hopes that he can work his way

178
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,699
through it all psychologically intact.

179
00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:45,819
When we met Agu in the opening scenes, he
was an expressive, clever, often joyful boy.

180
00:10:45,819 --> 00:10:50,529
This Agu is stone-faced, hardened, and cut
off from his own emotions.

181
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:52,139
He doesn’t even come close to smiling.

182
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,320
Eventually, he’s able to open up just a
little bit, tears hovering in his eyes.

183
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,040
Agu: If I'm telling this to you.

184
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,120
Agu: You will think that...

185
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,600
Agu:... I am some sort of beast.

186
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,480
Agu: Or devil.

187
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,320
We get the sense that he has a long way to
go, but also that this might be the first

188
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:21,329
step to recovery.

189
00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:26,290
The final shot shows Agu racing into the ocean
with the other boys, chasing and splashing,

190
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:30,809
and maybe – just maybe – reclaiming
a small fraction of the childhood that had

191
00:11:30,809 --> 00:11:32,130
been stolen from him.

192
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:36,449
Beasts of No Nation can be a tough movie to
watch, but, in a way, it’s also a deeply

193
00:11:36,449 --> 00:11:37,660
compassionate one.

194
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:42,019
Director Cary Fukunaga’s deep grasp of the
tools of cinema keep us anchored in his main

195
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:44,790
character’s perspective in a really artful
way.

196
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:49,060
And the grueling journey makes the sliver
of hope at the end all the more powerful.

197
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:54,129
Next time, we’ll tackle apes, monoliths,
and a deadly computer in one of the most influential

198
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:58,809
science fiction films ever made, Stanley Kubrick’s
2001: A Space Odyssey.

199
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:02,889
Crash Course Film Criticism is produced in
association with PBS Digital Studios.
