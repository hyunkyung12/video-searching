00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:03,360
Hey there, I’m Mike Rugnetta, this is Crash
Course Mythology, and today we’re gonna

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,420
put on our mythical coats, grab our mythical
hats, hop on a mythical mode of public transportation

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:12,250
and get ourselves into the hustle and bustle
of mythical cities.

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,429
Some of these cities are real, some are fictional,
and some are even metaphorical.

5
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:18,020
But all of them are metropolitain!

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,020
Come on, Thoth!

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:25,560
The Bifrost Bus only runs once an hour!

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,770
[Intro]
City myths can be tricky.

9
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:36,739
They’re not like other mythical places we’ve
looked at-- like gardens, caves, or mountains--because

10
00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:39,030
they don’t belong to the natural world.

11
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,350
They’re man made, or sometimes god made.

12
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,250
And this means that the stories we tell about
them can be a little different.

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,400
A lot of the stories we have about cities
are closer to tall tales, which are fun, but

14
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,800
they don’t meet our criteria for myth, mostly
because they’re, well...a little unserious.

15
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,120
A good example of a tall tale city is El Dorado,
the city of gold said to exist somewhere in

16
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,850
South America, that really tended to be more
of a metaphor for some ultimate prize that

17
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:07,829
one may search for endlessly… but likely
never actually attain.

18
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:13,420
And some urban tales are almost too serious--they’re
places that really existed, with archaeological

19
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:19,280
evidence and complicated histories that transcend
the stories we tell about them.

20
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,549
Probably the best known of these is Troy,
whose siege is described in the Iliad.

21
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:28,609
The archaeological history of Troy is fascinating,
but I’ll leave that for Crashcourse Archaeology.

22
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:29,609
Just kidding.

23
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:30,609
There’s no Crashcourse Archeology.

24
00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:31,840
[[[Thoth comes on like Indiana Jones.]]]

25
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,579
Or maybe we just haven’t discovered it yet.

26
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:38,700
Another significant archeological city that
has a mythical story attached to it is Jericho.

27
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,501
Jericho is one of the oldest cities in human
history, but is probably best known for the

28
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:49,109
story of its destruction at the hands of Joshua
in the Old Testament.

29
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:54,279
According to the story, the Lord tells Joshua
to march around the city walls for six days

30
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:59,859
with seven priests blowing ram’s horns as
they carry the ark of the covenant, a chest

31
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:02,279
that contains the ten commandments.

32
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:06,999
On the seventh day, following the Lord’s
instructions, Joshua has the army march around

33
00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:13,379
the city seven times and on the seventh circuit
he has the trumpets sound and the army shout

34
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:14,970
its war cry.

35
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,030
According to the book of Joshua, chapter 6,
verse 20:

36
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:23,849
“When the trumpets sounded, the army shouted,
and at the sound of the trumpet, when the

37
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:31,209
men gave a loud shout, the wall collapsed;
so everyone charged straight in, and they

38
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:32,209
took the city.”

39
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:36,719
It’s a great story, but archaeologists are
still arguing over whether or not a walled

40
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,019
city even existed at the time of Joshua.

41
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:44,890
And even if it did exist, trumpets probably
didn’t bring it down.

42
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:49,670
Looking at things etiologically, as we sometimes
do, is fun, but it isn’t ALWAYS possible

43
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,790
to reconcile myths and historical remains.

44
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:57,709
This is especially true of living cities,
which have to go about their business while

45
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:00,780
also existing as a repository of stories about
them.

46
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,299
Let’s start with a holy site mentioned in
the Bible, but still standing today, a holy

47
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:09,360
site common to all three Abrahamic religions:
Jerusalem.

48
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,180
It might be an understatement to say that
Jerusalem has been the subject of many stories.

49
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,999
And the imagery used to describe Jerusalem
changes dramatically depending upon who’s

50
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:21,609
doing the describing and when.

51
00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:23,910
Sometimes the city is beautiful, sometimes
ugly.

52
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:28,569
Sometimes Jerusalem is personified as a not
especially reputable mythic woman.

53
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:34,300
This is particularly true during the Babylonian
captivity, a time in the 6th century BCE when

54
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:40,170
the babylonian emperor Nebuchadnezzar kept
sacking Jerusalem and sending Jews into exile.

55
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:44,469
This all led to some complicated feelings
about Jerusalem.

56
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:46,790
The lamentations of Jeremiah begin:

57
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:51,980
How doth the city sit solitary, that was full
of people!

58
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:56,959
She is become as a widow, that was great among
the nations!

59
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,170
She that was a princess among the provinces
is become tributary!

60
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,170
(1:1)
Okay.

61
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,040
A tributary.

62
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,390
Not so bad.

63
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:09,389
But then it gets unpleasant, Jeremiah continues:

64
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:16,569
Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore
she is become as an unclean thing;

65
00:04:16,569 --> 00:04:21,488
All that honored her despise her, because
they have seen her nakedness:

66
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:25,559
Yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.

67
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:31,980
Her filthiness was in her skirts; she remembered
not her latter end;

68
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,960
Therefore is she come down wonderfully; she
hath no comforter: (1:8-9)

69
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,160
Yeah I mean, Jeremiah’s ambivalence is maybe
understandable.

70
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,430
It’s hard to see your sacred city conquered
and destroyed.

71
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:49,410
Though as for Jeremiah comparing the city
to a lewd and unclean woman, it’s not the

72
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:53,340
only time the Bible deploys the female image
unfairly.

73
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,009
But maybe we can read it as a lamentation
for a city that was supposed to nurture him

74
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:03,020
but is now taunting him and other Jews by
harboring their conquerors.

75
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,699
The Jews eventually go back and rebuild Jerusalem
so hopefully some of these feelings abate.

76
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:11,990
In the New Testament, Jerusalem is described
as a woman again, but this woman is more…

77
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,539
well, clean.

78
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:18,740
In the Book of Revelation, John invents an
idealized Jerusalem, a New Jerusalem intended

79
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,819
as a new spiritual home.

80
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:22,590
In chapter 12 he says:

81
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:28,650
And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem,
coming down out of heaven from God, prepared

82
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,440
as a bride adorned for her husband.

83
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,740
(Rev 21:2)
So which is it?

84
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:38,020
Bride or harlot covered in filth? ... both?

85
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:42,150
Some cities in the Bible are often classed
as places of sin -- Sodom and Gomorrah being

86
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:46,520
the most obvious example -- but let’s not
forget: cities also provide opportunities

87
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,639
for humankind to unite.

88
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,360
For the early Christians, the ideal city wasn’t
Jerusalem, but Rome.

89
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,430
We haven’t talked a great deal about Roman
mythology in this series, largely because

90
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:02,050
it draws heavily on Greek sources, but Romans
did create their own mythological history,

91
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,460
particularly for their city.

92
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:08,870
We’re going to look at two important myths
surrounding the founding of Rome, involving,

93
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,140
you might be shocked to learn: families and
violence.

94
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:17,379
One story of the foundation of Rome comes
from Virgil’s epic poem, The Aeneid.

95
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:22,560
This is the story of the Trojan hero, Aeneas,
who escapes the sack of Troy with his aged

96
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,090
father, his young son, and statues of his
household gods.

97
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,610
Eventually he makes his way to Italy where
he and his group of Trojans settle.

98
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:35,110
There, Aeneas marries Lavinia, the daughter
of the king of Latium.

99
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:40,610
Anchises, Aeneas’s dad, dies during the
journey, but in book six of the Aeneid, Aeneas

100
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:46,550
goes to the underworld and his father explains
to him the future history of Rome.

101
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,650
Anchises mentions a future descendant called
Romulus:

102
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:55,180
“Of him, my son,
Great Rome shall rise, and, favored of his

103
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:59,970
star,
Have power world-wide, and men of godlike

104
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,080
mind.

105
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,569
She clasps her seven hills in single wall,
Proud mother of the brave”

106
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:09,050
That’s right, it’s not Aeneas who founds
Rome.

107
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:15,099
It’s his son who settles at Alba Longa,
and a later descendant–Romulus–who builds

108
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:17,020
the city of seven hills.

109
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:22,159
But hold the mythical phone for just a moment...
who is this “Romulus”?

110
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:26,449
The story of Romulus and his twin brother
Remus begins in Alba Longa where a woman named

111
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:28,480
Rhea Silvia lives.

112
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:33,460
Unfortunately for Rhea, Mars, the god of war,
is obsessed with her.

113
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:38,699
And after cornering her in a sacred grove
he “seduces” her -- which, I mean, let’s

114
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:40,590
be real, probably he rapes her.

115
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:44,120
Now pregnant, Rhea goes to her uncle, King
Amulius, for help.

116
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,580
But Amulius is furious.

117
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,719
Instead of helping his niece, he imprisons
her.

118
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:55,789
When she finally gives birth, he orders her
twin sons to be left to die on the bank of

119
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:56,789
the Tiber river.

120
00:07:56,789 --> 00:08:02,169
Abandoned, the twins are suckled by a gentle
she-wolf until they’re found by a shepherd

121
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:05,189
named Faustulus who raises them.

122
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:09,530
Probably because of their early troubled life–oh
but also because they were sort of raised

123
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:14,380
by a wolf?–the boys turn to crime, eventually
stealing some of Amulius’s sheep.

124
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:18,789
Remus is captured and taken before Amulius
for trial.

125
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:24,160
At this point, Faustulus reveals to Romulus
the brothers’ true identities.

126
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,790
Romulus, in good criminal-hero fashion, sets
off for Alba Longa to get revenge on his great-uncle

127
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,790
the king.

128
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:34,130
Romulus kills Amulius and rescues Remus.

129
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:38,520
He gives the vacant throne to Amulius’s
grandfather Numitor and then the twins go

130
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,960
off to found their own city, which brings
us to the Thoughtbubble.

131
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:48,610
Romulus and Remus decide where they were abandoned,
on the banks of the Tiber, would be a great

132
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:53,410
place for a new city, but they can’t agree
on the exact location.

133
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:59,111
Romulus receives a sign from the gods telling
him to choose the Palatine hill as the site,

134
00:08:59,111 --> 00:09:02,630
so he sets out to mark the boundaries by digging
a ditch.

135
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:06,050
Remus sets up camp opposite him on the Aventine
hill.

136
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:11,360
Remus, the more headstrong of the two brothers,
jumps over the ditch to show Romulus that

137
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,610
it’s not exactly invasion proof.

138
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:21,090
Romulus, seeing this as sacrilege, kills his
brother and becomes the sole ruler of the

139
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,090
new city.

140
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:25,320
That’s why it’s called “Rome” and
not “Reem” and I think we’re all thankful

141
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,320
for that.

142
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,820
Imagine being a REEMAN instead of a ROMAN.

143
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,820
BUGH.

144
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:36,570
So Romulus has a spot for his city and no
rival twin, but he still has one big problem:

145
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,570
not enough people.

146
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:42,810
So he puts out the word that the hill will
be a refuge for the criminals and runaways

147
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:43,970
of Italy.

148
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,200
And that’s exactly who shows up.

149
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:53,040
Roman historian Livy calls them “a miscellaneous
rabble, without distinction of bond or free.”

150
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:59,320
But that rabble is almost entirely male, and
in order to populate the city, Romulus and

151
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:04,960
the city leaders invite visitors from neighboring
cities to celebrate a harvest festival with

152
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,040
them.

153
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:12,550
After the visitors arrive, at a pre-arranged
signal, the Romans seize all the young women.

154
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:16,810
And grow the Roman population through ... mass
rape.

155
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:19,390
BUGH
Thanks Thoughtbubble.

156
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:24,190
These stories, like the ones in the Bible,
remind us how easily myths can gloss over

157
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:28,580
or sometimes even glamorize terribly violent
actions.

158
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:33,620
The founding and conquering and defending
of cities can get really ugly.

159
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:38,350
Some myths reflect this, others choose to
pretty up their origin stories with magic

160
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,350
and stuff.

161
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:43,760
The story of Rome’s founding highlights
some of the complexity to be found in mythical

162
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,760
cities.

163
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,350
Many cities have origin stories, some more
historically grounded than others.

164
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:53,730
When we’re dealing with actual cities, that
have archaeological and written histories,

165
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:58,180
we often find that the myths surrounding the
city jibe with that history.

166
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:02,662
Jericho was besieged and conquered at some
point, though it’s unlikely that trumpet

167
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,280
blasts were responsible.

168
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:09,220
Rome, built on the Palatine, and became the
seat of one of the most expansive empires

169
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,610
in the world.

170
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:15,190
One empire that relied on cunning and violence,
characteristics that we might easily ascribe

171
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:21,270
to its pro-wolf, pro-rape, pro-conquest, brother-murderer
of a founder.

172
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,610
Cities are ambivalent, morally ambiguous places.

173
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,620
Kind of like everywhere else people live.

174
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,330
And with that, we’ve reached the border
of our final mythical place.

175
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:34,810
Next episode, we move on to the first examination
of mythical beasts.

176
00:11:34,810 --> 00:00:00,000
Thanks for watching, I’ll see you next time.
