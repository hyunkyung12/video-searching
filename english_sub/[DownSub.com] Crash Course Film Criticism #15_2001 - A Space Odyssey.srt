Well, here we are!

00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:24,630
The last episode of Crash Course Film Criticism.

4
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,540
So to round out this series, it’s time to
talk about a movie that’s known for being

5
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,660
both profound and timeless.

6
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,760
Occasionally a film comes along that touches
something so deep within the collective human

7
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,540
experience that it seems to exist outside
of time.

8
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,600
Often, these films dare us to see things in
new and unexpected ways.

9
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:01,840
In 1968, a movie that’s arguably a modern
masterpiece was released.

10
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,150
And it continues to reward multiple viewings
and interpretations five decades after it

11
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,509
first hit the screen.

12
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,240
It’s time to travel back to our old future,
with 2001: A Space Odyssey.

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:35,840
[Intro Music Plays]

14
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,400
2001: A Space Odyssey was dreamt up by director
Stanley Kubrick and science fiction writer

15
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,670
Arthur C. Clarke.

16
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,819
On the heels of his savagely satirical nuclear
war comedy, Dr. Strangelove or: How I Stopped

17
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:50,909
Worrying and Learned to Love the Bomb, Kubrick
was eager to expand his canvas.

18
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,159
He wanted to tackle a film that would burrow
deep into the viewer’s subconscious.

19
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:56,999
He wanted to make a modern myth.

20
00:01:56,999 --> 00:02:01,359
Or as his collaborator put it, Kubrick hoped
“to create a work of art which would arouse

21
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,770
the emotions of wonder, awe ... [and] even,
if appropriate, terror".

22
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:09,300
Years before, Clarke had written a short story
called “The Sentinel,” about the discovery

23
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,930
of an alien object buried under the surface
of the moon millions of years ago.

24
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,540
This “sentinel” acted as a kind of tripwire.

25
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,620
Once humans had become technologically advanced
enough to discover it, the object would warn

26
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,400
distant aliens of our existence.

27
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,390
From that idea, Kubrick saw an opportunity
to explore some of the most profound themes

28
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:30,200
in human history: the limits and consequences
of technology, the nature of existence, and

29
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,019
the evolution of humans — past, present,
and future.

30
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:36,599
Working from an outline based on Clarke’s
short story, Kubrick and his co-writer developed

31
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,569
a screenplay and a novel simultaneously.

32
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:43,190
They settled on an unconventional structure
that breaks the story into four distinct sections.

33
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:47,140
The first, called “The Dawn of Man,” follows
a group of prehistoric man-apes as they struggle

34
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,349
to survive.

35
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:52,300
They fight over food with plant-eating tapirs,
and spar over a watering hole with a rival

36
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,300
group.

37
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,730
Then one day they discover a mysterious object.

38
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:00,600
A tall, black, and perfectly rectangular slab
of… something, standing on the plains.

39
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,810
A monolith.

40
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,870
Soon after this meeting, the man-apes get
the idea to use broken bones as tools to hunt

41
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:09,562
with and weapons to fight and kill with, conquering
their hunger and their rivals.

42
00:03:09,562 --> 00:03:15,159
The chief man-ape then throws the bone into
the air and, as it rotates, the film cuts

43
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,959
to a shot of a spaceship mid-flight.

44
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,370
The second section of the film, which has
no title card, follows Dr. Heywood Floyd,

45
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,519
played by William Sylvester, an American scientist
traveling to the moon.

46
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:28,959
Once Floyd arrives at the moon base, he reminds
his colleagues of the need for secrecy, and

47
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,130
then travels with them to a hidden crater…
where they’ve excavated another monolith,

48
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,640
buried eons ago under the lunar surface.

49
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,099
Not long after Floyd approaches the slab and
touches it, the alien object emits a loud

50
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:41,739
and painful sound.

51
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:43,659
The tripwire has been activated.

52
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:46,519
Then we move into the film’s third section,
titled “Jupiter Mission.”

53
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:49,909
It’s eighteen months later, and we’ve
swapped protagonists again.

54
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:53,579
This part of the story follows a group of
astronauts and their supercomputer HAL – who

55
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:56,800
may or may not be sentient – on a long-distance
mission to Jupiter.

56
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,909
Eventually we’ll learn there’s a connection
to the monolith on the moon, but the exact

57
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:01,500
nature of this mission is never explained.

58
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,609
We follow two of the astronauts, Frank Poole,
played by Gary Lockwood, and Dave Bowman,

59
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:09,079
played by Kier Dullea, as they work
with HAL to oversee the space flight.

60
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,040
Meanwhile, their scientist-colleagues hibernate
in little pod-beds.

61
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,670
When Dave and Frank uncover what they think
may be a dangerous glitch in HAL, they secretly

62
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,310
plan to shut him down and continue the mission
on their own.

63
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,970
But HAL finds out.

64
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,990
He kills Frank and the sleeping scientists,
forcing Dave to make his way into the heart

65
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,850
of the ship and painstakingly destroy the
supercomputer.

66
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,240
Finally, we reach section four.

67
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,680
Dave’s ship arrives in Jupiter’s orbit,
where he discovers at least one more monolith

68
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,220
floating in space.

69
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,419
After investigating, Dave finds himself whisked
away on a psychedelic, perhaps even inter-dimensional

70
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:42,110
journey through space and time.

71
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:46,960
He ends up an old man in the most Kubrick
room ever built, with baroque furniture and

72
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,050
a glowing floor.

73
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:53,810
And when he dies, Dave transcends the material
realm and becomes a now-iconic starbaby.

74
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:58,470
The last shots of the film show the starbaby
returning to Earth and turning to the camera,

75
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,720
before the film cuts to black.

76
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,820
Whew!

77
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,699
Lots to chew on here.

78
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:08,590
One way critics have analyzed 2001 is to look
for patterns between the film’s four sections,

79
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,080
to understand what the story could be trying
to tell us.

80
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,450
The first clear pattern involves change, or
evolution.

81
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,919
You might notice how many times birthdays
are referenced.

82
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:20,341
The film begins with a section called the
“Dawn of Man,” basically “The Birth

83
00:05:20,341 --> 00:05:21,770
of Humans.”

84
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:26,520
Once we jump to our future on the moon, Heywood
Floyd calls his daughter to wish her a happy birthday.

85
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,200
Heywood Floyd: Can't you think of anything else you want for your birthday?

86
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,110
Then, once we’re aboard the Jupiter mission,
HAL discusses his “birth” as it were.

87
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,800
Then, once we're on board the Jupiter Mission, Frank Poole gets a message from home

88
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,800
wishing him a happy birthday.

89
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,680
Mrs. Poole: Happy birthday, darling.
Mr. Poole: Happy birthday, many happy returns!

90
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,960
And Hal discusses his birth, as it were.

91
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:54,120
HAL: I became operational at the H.A.L. Plant in Urbana, IL on the 12th of January,  1992.

92
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,880
Finally, when we reach the final room with
Dave Bowman, he turns into a newborn star-baby.

93
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:03,770
The film seems intensely interested in when
and how things evolve, as well as the consequences

94
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,470
those changes unleash.

95
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,360
Technology clearly plays a vital role in the
progress of the film, too.

96
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,740
It’s the man-ape’s discovery of simple
tools that paves the way for everything that

97
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,740
follows.

98
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,440
This reading is underlined by one of the most
famous cuts in cinema history, when Kubrick

99
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,319
and his editor Ray Lovejoy cut from the man-ape’s
spinning bone-tool to the spacecraft flying

100
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,539
among the stars.

101
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:28,610
This single cut not only carries us tens of
thousands of years into the future, but implies

102
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:33,419
all the technological advancement of those
years – the wrong turns, the dead-ends,

103
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:36,539
and the triumphs
Kubrick seems to suggest that humans evolved

104
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:39,740
not just along with, but because of technology.

105
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,750
And the monoliths present a question of technology,
too: Are they there to cause technological

106
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,900
leaps forward?

107
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,010
Or are they there to witness those leaps?

108
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:52,250
In Roger Ebert’s “Great Films” review,
he considers how the monolith could have affected

109
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,940
human evolution in this story.

110
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:58,990
He says, “I have always felt that the smooth
artificial surfaces and right angles of the

111
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:03,509
monolith, which was obviously made by intelligent
beings, triggered the realization ... that

112
00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:06,599
intelligence could be used to shape the objects
of the world.”

113
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:10,740
As we move into the second section, technology
surrounds the characters and carries them

114
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,740
into space.

115
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,729
Kubrick stages elaborate set pieces depicting
space shuttles docking and space stations

116
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:18,169
spinning to simulate Earth-like gravity.

117
00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:23,020
And the deliberate pace of all of this stands
in stark contrast to the chaos of the man-ape

118
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,020
lives.

119
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:28,050
To create these gorgeous sequences, both outside
and inside the spacecraft, Kubrick relied

120
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,750
on a mix of old and new cinematic technologies.

121
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:35,159
Front projection and carefully crafted model
work created the space flight sequences, as

122
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,539
the ships dance among the stars to Johann
Strauss’s “Blue Danube.”

123
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:49,440
[Blue Danube Plays}

124
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,430
And to create the interior of the spinning
station, Kubrick commissioned a giant ferris

125
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:57,640
wheel-like set that would actually rotate,
letting characters appear to be walking or

126
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,069
jogging up the walls.

127
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:02,990
Perhaps the most impressive aspect of all
this technology is that none of it is designed

128
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,659
to draw attention to itself.

129
00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:08,199
Kubrick wasn’t interested in making a fantastical
space opera.

130
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:13,800
Instead, his chief concern seems to be creating,
as closely as possible, the ways space travel

131
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,569
might actually happen.

132
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:18,979
That was stranger and more fascinating than
anything he could invent.

133
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:22,610
Some people have criticized the film for being
overly interested in technology at the expense

134
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,100
of fully developed characters.

135
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,100
And it’s true.

136
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,520
We don’t learn much about the inner life
of Floyd or Dave or anyone else.

137
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,880
But as the American film scholar Carrol L.
Fry argues, that may be the point.

138
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,570
In both the moon and “Jupiter Mission”
sections of the film, technology has outstripped

139
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:37,770
character relationships.

140
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:41,909
Specifically, he writes, “The film repeatedly
invites us to see the contrast between the

141
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:45,800
sophistication of technology … and the banality
of human conversation.”

142
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,930
From Floyd’s empty dialogue with his daughter
and his bureaucratic pleasantries on the moon,

143
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,610
to most of the conversations between Dave
and Frank on the ship, spoken words reveal

144
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,440
very little about the characters.

145
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,960
Woman: Now, are you sure you won't change your mind about that drink?

146
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,440
Heywood Floyd: Ya, I'm positive. Oh, I really must be going.

147
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,600
Frank: Well, what do you think?

148
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,280
Dave: I'm not sure, what do you think?

149
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,520
On the flip side, there’s so much time and
visual attention paid to the elaborate spaceship

150
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,310
docking procedures, their labyrinthine interiors,
and the panels of buttons, knobs, and computer

151
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,351
screens that control them.

152
00:09:17,351 --> 00:09:19,760
None of this is an accident on Kubrick’s
part.

153
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,100
In fact, it builds his case that technological
advances might doom interpersonal relationships.

154
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,329
Fry points out that the film’s most interesting
and complex character is the supercomputer

155
00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:30,329
HAL.

156
00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:34,370
And HAL becomes the ultimate extension of
this anti-tech argument when he starts killing

157
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,350
the human characters on screen.

158
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:40,410
This calls attention to another pattern within
the movie: territorial disputes that lead

159
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,410
to violence.

160
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:45,390
Just like the man-ape killing its rival over
the watering hole, and Floyd politely sparring

161
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,960
with his Russian counterparts, here we get
a battle between Dave and HAL.

162
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:56,320
Dave: Open the pod-bay doors, HAL.
HAL: I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that.

163
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,360
And when Dave finally succeeds in shutting
down HAL, the computer begs him to stop and

164
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,920
ultimately regresses to a more basic machine.

165
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:14,000
HAL: I'm afraid... I'm afraid, Dave.

166
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,520
Kubrick seems to be saying that Dave has to
destroy this incredibly sophisticated computer

167
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:22,639
to move into the film’s final transcendent
section.

168
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:27,170
And it’s this last section that invites
the widest variety of opinions and readings.

169
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,880
Bowman’s ship arrives at Jupiter to find
the planet perfectly in line with another

170
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,360
monolith and several other terrestrial bodies.

171
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,600
The monolith, which is also a recurring pattern
in the film, is often presented as a solid

172
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,670
piece of material.

173
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,810
A barrier.

174
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:43,600
In the “Dawn of Man” section, Kubrick
holds a wide shot for several minutes as he

175
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,720
observes the man-apes tentatively approach
the monolith, until one dares to touch it.

176
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,120
Once it’s deemed safe, they all crowd around
it.

177
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,250
This image echoes the shot of Floyd and his
fellow scientists gathered around their

178
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,290
monolith for a photograph.

179
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:59,839
In the film’s final section, however, Kubrick
presents the monolith as a kind of doorway.

180
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,420
And it’s through this doorway that Dave
begins his fantastical journey.

181
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:08,149
The colors flash and strange landscapes whiz
by, intercut with shots of Dave’s face inside

182
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:11,250
his space suit, distorting as he travels through
the cosmos.

183
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:15,690
As the images become more abstract, Kubrick
keeps cutting back to extreme close-ups of

184
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:18,480
Dave’s eye, grounding us in his point of
view.

185
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,230
This is Dave’s experience, he seems to
remind us.

186
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:26,060
And once Dave is in the baroque room and the
film cuts forward in time, toward his death,

187
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,019
each cut continues to pivot off Dave’s perception.

188
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:32,790
He looks into the room, and sees himself as
an old man with white hair.

189
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:37,769
That older Dave hoists himself up and walks
over to look for the original Dave, but can’t

190
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:38,769
find him.

191
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:42,779
Then, when old Dave looks back into the room,
he sees a really old Dave lying in bed.

192
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:46,820
That Dave looks past the foot of the bed
to see the monolith, once again appearing

193
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,030
as a kind of doorway.

194
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:52,450
And then an interesting change happens: We
get the monolith’s point of view, looking

195
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,459
back at the bed.

196
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:56,529
And we see a glowing ball of energy with some
kind of baby in it.

197
00:11:56,529 --> 00:12:00,410
This series of cuts seems to suggest that
Dave might have become the monolith, or

198
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:01,670
at least entered it.

199
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:05,720
Whatever the case, humanity seems to have
been called to this room over the eons, through

200
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,839
time and space, so that we – through Dave
– might be reborn.

201
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,410
In the film’s last shot, as the Dave-star-baby
creature looms over Earth and turns toward

202
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:18,550
us, its eyes appear older, soulful and intelligent.

203
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:22,360
And as it looks right into the camera, it
seems aware of us.

204
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,959
It also seems to have abandoned technology
altogether, able to travel vast distances

205
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,360
without the need for pods, ships, or simulated
gravity.

206
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,899
Technology may have been an essential part
of human evolution, but perhaps the only way

207
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:39,360
we can move to this next level is by conquering
technology and letting it go… somehow.

208
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,160
Whether we look at it as an examination of
the dangers of technology, or a thought experiment

209
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,709
centered on human evolution, there’s no
doubt that 2001: A Space Odyssey is a stunning

210
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:50,950
achievement of visual design and unconventional
storytelling.

211
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:55,360
And on top of all that, it’s an engaging,
watchable film made by a director at the peak

212
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,360
of his powers.

213
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,610
Kubrick was able to use cinema to explore
some of the deepest questions facing humankind

214
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,960
— in ways only a movie can.

215
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,640
I'm Michael Aranda, and this has been Crash Course Film Criticism.

216
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,090
Crash Course Film Criticism is produced in
association with PBS Digital Studios.

217
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,990
You can head over to their channel to check
out a playlist of their latest shows, like

218
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:17,470
It’s Okay to be Smart, Origin of Everything,
and Eons.

219
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:21,360
This episode of Crash Course was filmed in
the Doctor Cheryl C. Kinney Crash Course Studio

220
00:13:21,360 --> 00:00:00,000
with the help of these [nice people] and our
amazing graphics team is Thought Cafe.
