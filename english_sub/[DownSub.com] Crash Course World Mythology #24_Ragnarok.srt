00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hi, I'm Mike Rugnetta. This is Crash Course Mythology.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Last week we looked at Jewish, Christian, Zoroastrian and Islamic apocalypse myths.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And today we're gonna look at one apocalypse myth, one we've all been waiting for. The battle for the ages, the war to end all.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The inspiration for no fewer than 11 metal bands, according to Encyclopedia Metallum.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,200
That's right. It's the Norse apocalypse.

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,830
Ragnarok.

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:31,109
Battles, earthquakes, fire, blood, a giant wolf, groaning dwarves, and Loki, who is the worst.

8
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,540
That is, until he's not.

9
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,610
Because he dies. Oh! Spoiler alert!

10
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,499
In many versions of the norse myths

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,220
Ragnarok is the conclusion of one Loki story that we've already covered.

12
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:55,959
You might remember a few weeks ago when we talked about the beloved god Baldr and his brother Hodr,

13
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:01,059
How Loki tricked Hodr into killing Baldr by throwing a dart made of mistletoe and then

14
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,849
Loki disguises himself as a stubborn frost giant lady in order to prevent Baldr from escaping the underworld

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,920
Eugh, the nerve. That's where we left the story last time.

16
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,800
While Loki may have succeeded in getting rid of Baldr his pleasure is short-lived.

17
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:21,040
When the rest of the Aesir, the Norse gods of the sky, figure out they've been duped they fly into various rages,

18
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,300
Loki gets scared and poof! Amscrays outta Asgard's way.

19
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,600
The rest of the Aesir form a posse to bring Loki to justice.

20
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:32,000
Loki decides to hide out in a cave near Frananger Falls.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,700
If anyone comes by he can just transform himself into a salmon and hide in the churning water at the bottom of the waterfall.

22
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,419
And sure enough the Aesir posse shows up. Loki turns into a fish and dives for safety.

23
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:52,000
This is when Kvasir, the wisest of all the Aesir, pulls a Sherlock holmes and notices a burned fishnet in the remains of Loki's fire.

24
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:54,729
"Fish..." he says to himself.

25
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,339
Why would Loki be thinking about fish?

26
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:02,559
So the gods make a new net, Thor uses it to drag the nearby water

27
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,800
And Loki is caught.

28
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:09,949
The Aesir decide to not kill Loki, but to punish him and boy, do they ever!

29
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:17,600
First they find Vali and transform him into a wolf, then wolf Vali eats Loki's son Narvi,

30
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:23,000
then the gods take Narvi's entrails and use them to tie down Loki inside a cave

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,100
while Skaði, goddess of skiing, hangs a snake from a stalactite above Loki's head,

32
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,700
positioned so its venom will drop bit by bit,

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,800
right onto Loki's face, for eternity.

34
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,600
Somehow Loki's wife Sigyn arranges to stay with her husband

35
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,529
where she sits and uses a wooden bowl to catch the snake venom

36
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:50,500
But even so whenever she gets up to empty the bowl a few drops land right on Loki's face.

37
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,200
Rinse and repeat, except with snake venom, for eternity.

38
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:02,400
Or as Crossley-Holland put it, "That is how things are and how things will remain... Until Ragnarok."

39
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,200
This is actually where the timing gets a little complicated.

40
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,200
The story of Ragnarok is obviously very old, but it was originally told as a prediction.

41
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,200
This is how the world will end, later.

42
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:20,400
In theory, Loki is still tied up in that cave somewhere, like, right now, trying to get snake venom off of his face.

43
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:27,300
So the Ragnarok myth, it's less a story of something that already occurred and more like a script for something that's yet to come.

44
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,600
According to myth we'll know that Ragnarok is nigh because first we'll have Fimbulvinter.

45
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,400
Three long winters, all in a row.

46
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,110
Cold, bitter, unending winters that make people hungry,

47
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:43,000
and then angry and then fight and kill each other.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,600
Brothers killing brothers, sisters killing sisters, whole families turning against one another.

49
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,000
Like when you're on vacation and everyone skips lunch.

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,300
Civilization crumbles. Buildings are destroyed through war and neglect,

51
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:59,000
Humanity itself deteriorates and people become like wolves to each other.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,400
And then, when nearly all of the people have killed each other and those who are alive are acting like beasts,

53
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,600
the mythological wolves Sköll and Hati will come out and eat the sun and the moon.

54
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,800
The stars will fade and everything will go dark and cold

55
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,700
and there will definitely be no more smorgasbords.

56
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:24,200
Boy Norse howdy! Things haven't even Gotten going yet, because now the earthquakes begin.

57
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,600
We've talked about apocalyptic earthquakes before, the kind that topple trees and crumble mountains,

58
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,800
but these are earthquakes will also cause the Earth itself to shift,

59
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:40,000
and guess what, to break the bonds keeping Loki and his giant monster wolf son Fenrir in captivity.

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,800
And once Loki is free, the myth tells us, three roosters will crow,

61
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:50,200
waking the giants, the warriors of Valhalla, and the dead of single-hockey-stick Hel, the place.

62
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:58,000
Meanwhile Loki's other son, Jormungandr, the Midgard serpent, will churn through the seas as he heads toward the plain of Vígríðr.

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,799
Newly free and awake, Loki will lead his monstrous sons and all the minions of Hel to march on Asgard and challenge the Aesir.

64
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:10,750
He'll be joined by the giants, led by Surtr who carries a flaming sword.

65
00:05:10,969 --> 00:05:18,200
As this terrible force marches across the Bifrost towards Asgard, the great rainbow bridge will collapse behind them.

66
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:25,200
Heimdall, who sees further than any other god, will spot Loki coming and sound the Gjallarhorn in warning.

67
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:31,600
The all-father Odin, seeing the impending battle, will turn to his trusted adviser Mimir for advice

68
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:40,200
but when giants are marching and your rainbow bridge is in pieces and Fenrir and the Midgard serpent are loose... A pep talk isn't really gonna help.

69
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:48,300
And so the Aesir will gear up for battle alongside the Einherjar, 800 of the most honorable Dead Warriors from Valhalla.

70
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:55,029
The Aesir and the Einherjar will follow Odin to the plain of Vígríðr to face Loki's onslaught,

71
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:58,000
perhaps best dealt with in the Thought Bubble.

72
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,200
the battle begins and quickly turns into a collection of heroic duels.

73
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:07,200
The fight doesn't go well for anyone. Tyr and Garmr kill each other in battle,

74
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:15,200
Thor defeats Jormungandr but not before the dying serpent spews venom all over the thunder god and Thor falls, poisoned.

75
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,600
Even Loki and Heimdall fight so savagely that they slay each other,

76
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,000
which I guess means someone else will have to be the worst now? Anyone have any nominations?

77
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,399
As for Odin, he attacks with his mighty spear, Gungnir

78
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,000
But Fenrir seizes Odin in his mighty jaws and swallows the all-father.

79
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:40,200
With Odin consumed an unlikely hero arises: Odin's son Víðarr and his great magic shoe.

80
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:47,700
Víðarr's mythical shoe is made up of all the thrown-away scraps of all the shoes that have been made since the beginning of time.

81
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:51,000
It is huge and indestructible.

82
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,200
And so Víðarr stomps his mythic shoe down of Fenrir's bottom jaw,

83
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,600
grabs the wolf's top jaw and rips his head apart;

84
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,800
Guitar solo.

85
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,200
The end of the battle comes when Surtr, leader of the giants, finally defeats Freyr.

86
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,700
He turns, with his flaming sword sets all the worlds aflame.

87
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,100
According to one version of the story,

88
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,600
Asgard and Midgard and Jotunheim and Niflheim will become furnaces -

89
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,600
places of raging flame, swirling smoke, ashes, only ashes.

90
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:27,200
The Einherjar will die, men and women and childre in Midgard will die,

91
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:34,000
elves and dwarves will die, giants will die, monsters and creatures of the underworld will die,

92
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,200
birds and animals will die. The sun will be dark and there will be no stars in the sky.

93
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,000
The earth will sink into the sea.

94
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Thank you, Thought Bubble.

95
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,600
Okay, so look, Ragnarok doesn't end well.

96
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:52,500
The world has been destroyed by flames and all the people and all the gods are dead and everything is darkness.

97
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,100
Except in this end of the world story there is a silver lining.

98
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:01,000
Because the worlds are consumed by flames what remains is water,

99
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,500
and as we've seen in creation stories, water has some pretty impressive generative powers.

100
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,900
Accordingly, "The earth will rise again out of the water, fair and green.

101
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:16,600
The eagle will fly over cataracts, swoop into the thunder and catch fish under crags.

102
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,700
Corn will ripen in fields that were never sown."

103
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,949
But hold on, it gets even better.

104
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,699
It turns out that not all of the gods perished in the massive inferno.

105
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:30,200
Odin's sons Víðarr and Vali and Thor's sons Magni and Móði survive the fire.

106
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,600
They make their way to the plain of Iðavöllr,

107
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,800
where they're joined by Baldr and Hodr, who have come back from the world of the dead.

108
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:41,600
Hoenir and the children of Vili and Ve round out a new pantheon.

109
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,000
The best part is what happens when these new gods gather together.

110
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,800
They sit down and they talk, telling the stories that only they know,

111
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,300
the same stories of the Norse gods that we are talking about right now.

112
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,640
In the grass of Iðavöllr they find some of the treasures of the Aesir,

113
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:01,900
including Mjolnir and special golden chess boards and their pieces.

114
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:07,800
In a recent retelling of the Ragnarok story by Neil Gaiman, these pieces are the characters from the myths:

115
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,200
Loki and his children, the frost giants and Surtr.

116
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:19,100
Gaiman ends the story writing: "Baldr will smile like the sun coming out, and reach down, and he will move his first piece.

117
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,200
There's a lot to unpack in the Ragnarok myth.

118
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,800
Starting with whether or not it's really a reflection of the pre-Christian Germanic tradition.

119
00:09:25,869 --> 00:09:30,100
You probably noticed a lot of similarities between the Christian story of the apocalypse:

120
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,300
from the blowing of the horns to the earthquake and the fire...

121
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:39,000
But more importantly the most beautiful and beloved of the gods, in this case Baldr, returns from the dead.

122
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:44,200
Our main sources for this story, the Eddas, were written down well after Christianity

123
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,800
became dominant in Northern Europe and Iceland.

124
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,300
Were the original myths influenced by Christianity?

125
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,600
Well, it depends upon which scholar you ask.

126
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,200
Interestingly, unlike some of the other apocalypses,

127
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,000
this one is a beginning as well as an end.

128
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,500
The Christian and Zoroastrian stories also establish the beginning of a new age,

129
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,900
but Ragnarok, even though it's clearly set in the future,

130
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,000
prefigures a renewed world that looks a lot like the old one.

131
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,400
In Gaiman's retelling we almost have the feeling that Ragnarok has happened,

132
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,200
even if we're specifically told its events are in the future.

133
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,800
The idea that the end of the world can also be the beginning of the world isn't unique, though.

134
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,400
In Hindu mythology the fourth age, also known as the Kali age,

135
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:29,600
sees humans afflicted by corrupt rulers and all the social order upended.

136
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,400
As in the Norse story, the world will be consumed first by drought and then by fire,

137
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:40,100
followed by a storm lasting many years, and the rebirth of a new world here on Earth.

138
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:45,500
The cyclical nature of the Hindu myth as well as the twisting of time is expressed this way:

139
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:52,000
"A day of Brahma, born from the lotus, lasts a thousand periods of four ages;

140
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,609
a night, when the world is destroyed and made into a vast ocean, is of the same length.

141
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:05,900
and at the end of the night, Vishnu, unborn, having awakened, takes the form of Brahma in order to create,

142
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,169
as it has already been told to you.

143
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:13,000
This Indian apocalypse story and Ragnarok are both oddly hopeful.

144
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,400
They explain that destruction is necessary for creation.

145
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:22,800
Unlike the apocalypse of the Bible's book of revelations, they don't promise a new world only for the righteous,

146
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,969
but a rebirth for everyone!

147
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:29,000
You get a rebirth, and you get a rebirth, and you get a rebirth!

148
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,059
Thanks for watching, we'll see you next time.
