00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
Hey there, I'm Mike Rugnetta.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,100
This is Crash Course Mythology and today, we're going to talk about

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,400
symbols, dreams and a couple of very busty figurines.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,620
It's the great mother goddess.

5
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:10,600
Are you excited Thoth?

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,099
Yeah, I know, you don't have a mother, you created yourself, but come on!

7
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:15,070
She's the best!

8
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:20,440
Unless, of course, she doesn't exist and if that's the case, what do I do with all of these great goddess mother's day cards?

9
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,700
The mother goddess is an archetype.

10
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:39,580
Psychology fans will know about archetypes from the work of Carl Jung, who saw the repeated patterns in myths

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,960
as emanations of what he dubbed humanity's collective unconscious,

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,080
meaning the symbols and ideas that all

13
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,000
humans share simply as a result of being human.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,400
Archetypes can be used to explain why the same

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,440
patterns emerge in different myths from different places throughout the world.

16
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:02,119
Some of the archetypes that repeat all willy-nilly are the dying God, the destroyer God,

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:09,120
the trickster and the primordial pairing of the sky and the earth. Hey Sky Dad, hey Earth Mom.

18
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,340
The archetypes we'll be examining in the next few episodes are just those:

19
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,740
the Father Creator and the Great Mother.

20
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:22,490
Ugh, cosmic parents. I mean I guess the upside is that if you have to move back in with them after graduation their basement is

21
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:24,479
literally infinite

22
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,899
Downside being of course that it is also literally Hades.

23
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:33,259
We're doing an episode on female divinity before archetypal male divinity because there are some theories that Earth mom

24
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:40,279
actually did come first. As I pointed out most human societies are patriarchal and have been for a long

25
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,159
long time, but certain historians,

26
00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:50,659
sociologists, archaeologists, literary critics and mythologists have argued that in prehistoric times human societies were more

27
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:57,409
matrifocal, less violent and more cooperative. The idea that human societies began as matrifocal and goddess

28
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:04,369
oriented goes back a long long way, with scholars asserting that many if not most primitive societies featured a religion

29
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:07,638
that was based around ideas of fertility and motherhood.

30
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:12,499
According to mythologists Scott Leonard and Michael McClure, "Throughout the 19th and 20th

31
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,950
centuries the literature of several disciplines took for granted

32
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:22,600
the existence of primal mother or great goddess and further assumed that her religion and the societies

33
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,179
based upon it were part of the primitive past from which man

34
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,309
happily escaped through the logocentric power of intellect." Yeah, that's right

35
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:38,419
We reasoned ourselves right out of peace, fertility and harmony. Good going, human mind. A leading proponent of the great goddess

36
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,650
theory was Maria Gimbutas who connected

37
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,550
archaeology to the women's movement

38
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:47,520
and who probably would have liked it a lot if you put the Venus of Willendorf on your sign at the woman's march.

39
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:55,589
Those involved with the goddess movement of which Gimbutas was a leader saw in this mother-centric religion "an appealing alternative to the brutality,

40
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:02,940
materialism, spiritual bankruptcy and ecological shortsightedness of modern patriarchal social systems."

41
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:07,019
Whoa, tell us what you really think. The goddess movement is a very cool idea

42
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:13,200
but it does have a couple problems. For one: It's based a lot on images like this one. Hey, there

43
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,559
she is again, the Venus of Willendorf. Sort of makes you feel more fertile already.

44
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,550
But here's the thing. The discovery of female figures like the Venus of Willendorf

45
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,470
was taken as evidence of religious practices that focus on the fertility aspects of the female,

46
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:32,100
but there's no real proof that figurines like these were part of any worship or ritual at all

47
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,390
Maybe they were just sexy lawn ornaments. There are problems with creating a picture of

48
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:44,429
female-centric social organizations based on figures like this that signified fertility and magical desires for successful births.

49
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:49,470
Also, we've discovered lots of female figurines and not all of them have the...

50
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:56,399
attributes associated with fertility and not all the figurines are female; many of them are male, a lot of them are even

51
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:03,630
androgynous. This lack of gender specificity points to what might be the biggest challenge to the goddess school. It relies on

52
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,910
modern gender binaries and

53
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:12,450
stereotyping. "Supporters of the goddess movement reversed the values of male-dominated Victorian

54
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:18,899
era science, which saw women as primitive, natural beings separate from an inferior to, rational men,

55
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:20,429
never questioning

56
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,220
whether our prehistoric forebears imposed the same

57
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:24,970
male-female polarities

58
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:32,459
upon their world or held the same assumption about the erotic and to the symbolic as we do." This is a good reminder that we

59
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:38,040
always need to be aware of how we are imposing our own beliefs and values on history and prehistory

60
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,369
And if I can impose my own values for a second, yes,

61
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,349
Victorian science is the worst. So, maybe you believe in a fertile, peaceful,

62
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,760
paleolithic, matriarchal world order that spawned great goddess myths around the world,

63
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:56,000
maybe you don't, but there stories of goddesses from everywhere at all times

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,480
and they share some

65
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,480
similarities. One of the most common literary

66
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:05,120
ideas is that of the triple goddess, which Robert Graves wrote about in his book, The White Goddess. An

67
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:10,370
influential typology, the triple goddess sorts goddesses into one of three types:

68
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:17,210
virgin, mother, and crone. If you find this virgin, mother, crone thing troubling, you are not alone;

69
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:24,440
It's a system that sees women through the eyes of men and basically categorizes them on whether they're sexy, and since that is

70
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:32,990
uncomfortable-making, we're going to look at the basic roles of goddesses in myths in the terms used by Maria Gimbutas: life, death, and

71
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:40,250
regeneration. Goddesses of life are maternal, often associated with the life-giving Earth. The Greek Gaia is a prime example,

72
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,549
although there aren't a lot of myths about her specifically.

73
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,590
She's often supplanted by Demeter. Sometimes these life-giving goddesses are associated with primeval

74
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,049
creation like Tiamat in the Sumerian creation

75
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:58,910
stories, or Cipactli, the great goddess of Mexico who swam through the primordial waters of chaos in the form of an enormous

76
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:07,040
crocodile, which seems like a pretty sweet way to travel. Life-giving goddesses are occasionally seen as protectors as well as nurturers.

77
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,270
An example is the Persian goddess Anahita, who was sometimes depicted in armor,

78
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:17,989
sometimes as a nurturing mother and who was said to have power over the water; in dry-as-heck with two hockey sticks Persia,

79
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,989
Water mom brings forth and preserves life and, as moms often do, also probably reminds you to shower.

80
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,149
Goddesses of death are often seen as queens of the underworld, like Persephone, whom we've met, and

81
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:35,449
Isis who was able to resurrect her husband Osiris. In these roles great goddesses control the cycles of growth,

82
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,740
decay and rebirth:

83
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:44,060
the seasons. One of the goddesses we met in an earlier episode Izanami died and went to the underworld after giving birth to fire.

84
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:49,219
Her husband Izanagi went to look for her, but, finding her as a rotting corpse, was

85
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,620
terrified, so he ran away.

86
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,040
I mean,

87
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:58,609
can you blame him? Izanami considered this a divorce, which also seems reasonable, and so she returned to the underworld.

88
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,530
On occasion, goddesses associated with death are portrayed as witches or seers,

89
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:10,569
often appearing as wise old women, like the Greek witch Hecate, who is sometimes said to have three heads: a snake's, a

90
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:16,809
horse's and a dog's, making her a one-goddess petting zoo. Death goddesses are also often associated with fate,

91
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,750
apportioning a person's life, ordaining health, disease,

92
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,459
prosperity and suffering. The Greek Moirai and the Norse Norns were goddesses of this type. And finally, goddesses of regeneration

93
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:32,409
often relate to sexuality in myths, appearing as virgins or nymphs.

94
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:37,359
Sometimes they're also responsible for creativity: according to Leonard and McClure, their pulsing

95
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:43,090
Sexual energies impel mortal creation to renew itself, and thus their influence redeems

96
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:50,410
individual mortality through beauty, passion, and offspring." Pulsing sexual energy? Oof, is it getting hot in here or

97
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:57,309
is it just these mother goddesses? One other interesting thing about goddesses of regeneration: they seem to have a tendency to bestow their favors on

98
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:04,269
mortal men and that just does not seem to work out. For example: We're going to go somewhere we haven't visited yet:

99
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,450
Ireland. Take us there, Thought Bubble. One Irish

100
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:15,010
regeneration goddess is Nimah of the Golden Hair, whose name means beauty. Nimah was the daughter of the sea and

101
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:23,109
Tir-Nan-Og, the land of the blessed. One day Nimah stole the poet Oisin away from his people and brought him to Tir-Nan-Og,

102
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:28,179
where they lived together as lovers for what turned out to be a very long time.

103
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,500
While he was with her, Oisin remained young and virile.

104
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:38,229
Enchanted as he was, Oisin forgot about his people who continued to age and to die as

105
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,399
mortals tend to do. He stayed at Tir-Nan-Og for centuries,

106
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,239
and really, it's tough to blame him, but Oisin became homesick.

107
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,270
Eventually Nimah grew tired of his complaining

108
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:54,489
so she sent him home on a magical horse with a warning not to dismount.

109
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,640
But as soon as the magical steed touched human soil,

110
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:05,020
the saddle buckle broke and Oisin fell to the ground. In an instant, all of the centuries that Oisin had spent on the isle of

111
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:09,789
the blessed caught up with him, and he grew old and died. Strangely

112
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:16,780
there's an almost identical story from Japan. In this one the sea goddess Oto-Hime falls in love with a mortal fisherman and

113
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:24,529
takes him to her palace under the sea. After a few days of romance, the fisherman starts to worry about the people he left at home.

114
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,000
He begs Oto-Hime

115
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,929
to let him return and she agrees, but only if he promises to carry a tiny box to the surface and

116
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,970
never open it.

117
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:40,850
So, you see where this is going; hundreds of years had passed, not just a few days, and guess what?

118
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,060
He opens the box. All of the years that had passed

119
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:49,729
surround him like a mist, and his body withers into dust. Thanks for that Thought Bubble, that was...

120
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,950
uplifting? So great mother goddesses can create the world and grant you

121
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,789
fertility and peace and equality and all that other good stuff,

122
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:04,219
or they can steal you away from your home, ravish you for a couple centuries and then turn your body into dust. That's part of what

123
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,700
makes great goddesses so powerful. No matter what form they take,

124
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:11,059
they're usually multifaceted. Unlike some gods

125
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:18,079
I could name. *cough* Zeus. Great goddesses are almost always complex and contradictory, which is the way we like it here at Crash Course.

126
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:22,519
I'm definitely sending that mother's day card now. Thanks for watching, we'll see you next time
