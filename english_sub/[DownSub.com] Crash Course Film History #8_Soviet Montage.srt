1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,509
The Russian Revolution marked the first major
civil war fought in the age of cinema.

2
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:11,230
And the big winners in that struggle understood
the unique ability of film to change minds

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,230
and inflame hearts.

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,530
Today, we’ll meet a bunch of filmmakers
who spent as much time studying films as

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:16,530
they did making them.

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,830
We’ll see the founding of the world’s
first film school.

7
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,710
And we’ll watch the rise of a cohesive,
self-conscious, and game-changing film movement

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,609
that would unlock the power of the cut to
create meaning, shape public opinion, and

9
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:27,920
call a hungry populace to action.

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,240
It’s time to cut...
to Soviet Montage.

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:45,460
[Opening Music Plays]

12
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,940
In 1917, the second of two violent revolts

13
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,220
in Russia, led by Vladimir Lenin, overthrew
the Tsar and brought the Bolsheviks to power.

14
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,200
“Bolshevik” means “majority” in Russian,
by the way, and this political movement grew

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,170
from the peasant and working classes who acquired
their power through persuasion and force.

16
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:00,170
That’s important.

17
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,170
You should remember that.

18
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,950
Because the resulting government, ruled by
what would become the Communist Party, was

19
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:07,380
organized around principles of workers’
rights, state control of industry, and the

20
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,380
suppression of dissent.

21
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,710
So the government took a strong interest in
film, because it recognized cinema for what

22
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,359
it was – a powerful tool for social and
political influence.

23
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:17,729
But before it could get that engine started,
the party had a few obstacles to overcome.

24
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:20,430
First, it needed to centralize the Russian
film industry.

25
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,080
Prior to the revolution, there were a lot
of production companies, mostly making pro-Tsarist films.

26
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,800
In 1918, the new Bolshevik government did
what Germany had done in creating UFA – which

27
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:28,850
we talked about last time.

28
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:32,740
They took over the studios, combining them
to form one state-owned company called Narkompros,

29
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,170
also known as The People’s Commissariat
for Education.

30
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,240
Second, and more importantly, there was virtually
no raw film stock in the country.

31
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,980
You're gonna need film stock if you're gonna make films.

32
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,580
The revolutionary government choked off imports,

33
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,810
and Russia didn’t have the capacity to manufacture
much of its own stock.

34
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,689
So, some enterprising Russian filmmakers took
a different approach.

35
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:50,600
They started studying films.

36
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,640
What?!?! That’s what you’re doing right now!

37
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,049
And they didn’t just watch them; they dissected them.

38
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:56,049
Literally.

39
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,670
They took the actual reels of film, cut them
apart, and analyzed them.

40
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:59,670
How long were the shots?

41
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,670
What was the camera angle?

42
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,480
How was the image composed?

43
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,529
How did they do the thing?

44
00:02:02,529 --> 00:02:05,280
And most importantly, how were the shots edited
together?

45
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:06,759
In what order, and why?

46
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:10,539
Then they began experimenting – rearranging
the order of the shots, shortening some, repeating

47
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:12,620
others – all to see what the effects might
be.

48
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:17,160
To encourage this experimentation, the government
founded the world’s first film school in 1919.

49
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,720
It was called VGIK, or the State Institute
of Cinematography.

50
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,920
The most well-known and influential teacher
at this new school was the filmmaker Lev Kuleshov.

51
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,239
And his most famous discovery bears his name
and provided his students with the cornerstone

52
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:30,890
of a new cinematic philosophy.

53
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:34,860
What he discovered is now known as the Kuleshov
Effect, and it came to light like this:

54
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,010
Kuleshov took a shot of a well-known Russian
matinee idol named Ivan Mosjoukine

55
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,129
staring off-camera with no expression.

56
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:44,200
He then cut to an image of a bowl of soup,
and then back to the shot of Ivan.

57
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,079
When he asked viewers what Ivan was feeling,
they said he was hungry.

58
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:50,570
Kuleshov then took the same footage of Ivan,
but this time intercut it with a shot of a

59
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,570
girl in a coffin.

60
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,680
Now, the audience said Ivan felt sad.

61
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,950
Finally, Kuleshov projected the shot of Ivan,
then cut to a woman on a couch.

62
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,660
The viewers said he was feeling desire.

63
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,730
The Kuleshov Effect suggests that viewers
draw more meaning from two shots cut together,

64
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,810
than either shot on its own.

65
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,719
And the Soviet filmmakers believed that
phenomenon was the true power of cinema, something

66
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:13,700
no other art form can do: juxtapose two images
in real time to create a new, and sometimes

67
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,700
unrelated, meaning.

68
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,409
It’s also one more example of film as an
illusion of reality.

69
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:21,700
Kuleshov took Georges Méliès one step further:
not only can a cut be used to hide a magic

70
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,540
trick, it is a magic trick!

71
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,700
And that wasn’t Kuleshov’s only contribution.

72
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,700
Or his only illusion.

73
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,700
He also developed a concept called Creative
Geography, also known as Artificial Landscape.

74
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,209
This effect can be created when two segments
of film shot in entirely different locations

75
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:37,180
are cut together to make them appear to be
happening in a continuous space.

76
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,430
If you’ve watched Doctor Who, this is how
they make it seem like the TARDIS is bigger

77
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,520
on the inside.

78
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,080
Just kidding. It actually is!

79
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,740
We call the overarching theory of film developed

80
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,549
by Kuleshov and his students Soviet Montage.

81
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:51,420
Montage comes from the French word, meaning
“assembling” or “editing” or... "montage."

82
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,189
And the theory of montage proposes that films
derive their ultimate power and meaning through

83
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:59,170
the way the shots are cut together – their
order, duration, repetition, and rhythm.

84
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:03,189
Beyond that, Soviet Montage filmmakers believed
that for film to reach its true potential,

85
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:05,020
the cuts themselves should be visible.

86
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,340
The audience should be aware of them.

87
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,900
That the illusion should be obviously constructed, and not hidden.

88
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,959
We call this style of editing discontinuity
editing, and it fit quite neatly into another

89
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,480
political idea the Soviet Montage filmmakers
had: that the artist was an engineer, simply

90
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,459
another worker, joining shots the way a brick-layer
builds a wall or a factory worker assembles

91
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:22,459
a vehicle.

92
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,000
For these folks, the process of filmmaking
was as much a political statement

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,460
as the movie itself.

94
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,789
Within Soviet Montage, there are a lot of
ways to juxtapose images.

95
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:32,419
There’s Intellectual Montage, for example,
which refers to the juxtaposition of two otherwise

96
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:35,370
unrelated images to create a third idea in
your mind.

97
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,660
This is the purest form of Soviet Montage,
and Kuleshov’s experiment is a perfect example.

98
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,710
Ivan’s face juxtaposed against soup equals
hunger.

99
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:47,000
Tonal Montage puts together two or more shots
that have similar tonal or thematic qualities.

100
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,610
The idea here is that these shots build on
one another and reinforce the emotional or

101
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,870
psychological meaning the film is trying to
convey..

102
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,470
Two rams butting heads next to a fist next
to people rioting and you’ve got images

103
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,970
that may make you think of conflict.

104
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:02,479
But, a flower opening next to a baby yawning
next to a sunrise might be beginnings.

105
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,410
To take a great – and decidedly non-Soviet
example – think about Dumbledore’s death

106
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:12,690
scene in Harry Potter.

107
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:17,199
The shots between Snape and Dumbledore are
drawn out, still, each wrestling with his

108
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,130
emotions, followed by Dumbledore’s slow-motion
fall.

109
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,950
Metric Montage dictates that shots are cut
after a specified number of frames, regardless

110
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,430
of what’s happening in the shot.

111
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:29,190
This can be quite jarring, as on-screen actions
are interrupted, but the rhythm of the editing

112
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,400
itself has a psychological effect.

113
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,060
The speeding up or slowing down of edits can
greatly affect the amount of tension the audience

114
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,060
is feeling.

115
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,190
There are moments in the famous shower scene
from Psycho where Hitchcock uses this technique,

116
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:43,000
cutting between the knife and the victim without
regard for continuity, tone, or musical rhythm.

117
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,880
And, any modern action movie tends to pick
up the pace of the editing as the fight scenes

118
00:05:58,889 --> 00:05:59,889
pick up intensity.

119
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:03,700
Rhythmic Montage, on the other hand, matches
the cuts to music, sound effects, or action on screen.

120
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,680
Marching feet or beating drums.

121
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,360
Modern movie trailers do this all the time,
using music to link various shots from a movie.

122
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,640
And finally, overtonal Montage is the combination of metric, rhythmic, and tonal montage.

123
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,220
One of the best examples of Overtonal Montage

124
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,140
comes from the final stand off in The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.

125
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:35,600
we see Tonal Montage in the Mise en Scene. Desert, cracked Earth, tired and weathered faces,

126
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,840
a cemetery, this is the end, death is coming.

127
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,860
[Craig sings theme from The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly]

128
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,300
Rhythmic Montage is pretty obviously used as the scene is punctuated

129
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,920
with cuts of the 3 gunslingers based on the rhythm of Ennio Morricone's incredible score.

130
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,500
Finally, Metric Montage.

131
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,300
We begin the sequence is long cuts

132
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,600
but as the intensity picks up, we cut faster and faster and faster UNTIL!

133
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,300
Now, imagine you’re a Soviet Montage filmmaker,
and you’ve spent months or years studying

134
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,039
films and developing your theories.

135
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,760
What happens when you finally get your hands
on some fresh film stock in the early 1920s?

136
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,760
That’s right.

137
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,540
You start making films with a vengeance.

138
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,060
Not, like, films with "a vengeance" in the title, like Die Hard with A Vengence

139
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,640
but like, you make films with the attitude of vengeance.

140
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,400
One of the most influential Soviet Montage
filmmakers was a former engineering student

141
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,780
named Sergei Eisenstein.

142
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,250
It was Eisenstein’s second feature film,
Battleship Potemkin, that launched him to

143
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,949
international fame and provided a blueprint
for how filmmakers could incorporate Soviet

144
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:59,080
Montage theories – particularly intellectual
montage – into fiction films.

145
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,830
Made in 1925, Battleship Potemkin tells the
true story of a mutiny aboard a Russian battleship

146
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,990
in 1905.

147
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:08,580
Rather than focus on a single protagonist,
the film dramatizes the miserable conditions

148
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:12,129
of the sailors as they toil under officers
who beat them and deprive them of food.

149
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:15,889
In the film’s most famous section, the Odessa
Steps Sequence, the sailors are cheered on

150
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:19,379
by the people of Odessa… until Tsarist troops
show up and slaughter the crowd.

151
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:23,139
The shots themselves are fairly horrifying
– bullet wounds, trampled children, anguished

152
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:26,540
parents, a baby carriage rolling perilously
through the middle of the battle.

153
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:30,080
But Eisenstein’s real innovation lies in
the use of montage to bring life to the chaos,

154
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,860
madness, and violence of the action.

155
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,760
Eisenstein wanted the juxtaposition of sometimes-unrelated
images to jolt the audience out of their complacency.

156
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,669
The film is also a powerful piece of propaganda,
which we’ll define as a biased or misleading

157
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:44,099
communication designed to promote a particular
point of view.

158
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:46,750
And just because something’s propaganda
doesn’t mean that it’s false.

159
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,520
The Tsarists really did put down a revolt
in Odessa in 1905!

160
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,320
But by making the sailors and civilians so
innocent and the officers and Tsarist troops

161
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,130
so cruel, the film comes down on one side
and stokes the viewer’s outrage against

162
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,130
the other.

163
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,529
We’ve seen this before – in the egregious
re-writing of American history in Birth of

164
00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:04,660
a Nation – and we see it today – in everything
from political ads to issue documentaries.

165
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,160
Film was and remains one of the most powerful
tools of persuasion in the world.

166
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,880
Another Soviet filmmaker who excelled at persuasion,
but took a different approach to montage,

167
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,740
was the documentarian Dziga Vertov.

168
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,130
Vertov began his career as an editor in 1918,
before becoming a cameraman and travelling

169
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,740
around the country taking newsreel footage.

170
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,390
Vertov was an opinionated and rigorous thinker,
and he banded together with other like-minded

171
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,850
documentarians to propose their own ideas
about film.

172
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,290
They called themselves “Kinoki” or “Cinema-Eye”
and

173
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,350
wrote manifestos dissing fiction films.

174
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,970
They believed that only documentaries could
be true and honest.

175
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,500
Vertov’s goal was to use the camera to record
quote-unquote “reality,” and then arrange

176
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,089
his shots using montage to create pure meaning,
rather than tell a story.

177
00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:43,350
His masterwork is The Man with the Movie Camera,
made in 1929.

178
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,870
It follows a day in the life of a city, from
empty streets and sleeping figures through

179
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,550
work and meals and evening traffic.

180
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,980
Actually, the film is as much about the process
of making the film as it is about anything else.

181
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,980
We see the cameraman shooting the footage.

182
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,980
We see the editor, Yelizaveta Svilova, who
was also Vertov’s wife, choosing shots and

183
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,300
cutting them together into sequences that
we then see unfold on screen.

184
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,350
Vertov uses special effects, freeze frames,
special camera rigs, animation, compositing,

185
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,029
even non-linear editing – all the tools
cinema had at the time.

186
00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:11,550
He painted a portrait of his city, its people,
and the artist as an engineer, pulling back

187
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,980
the curtain to reveal the truth of how the
film was made.

188
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,630
But of course, as we’ve talked about, film
is ultimately an illusion of reality, not

189
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,750
reality itself.

190
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,070
Film scholars have long recognized that however
useful Vertov’s theories were in making

191
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:26,560
films, they don’t account for the fact that
all moving photographs are by nature constructed realities.

192
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,600
Whether they’re in service of a fictional
story or a documentary, they’re chosen and

193
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,580
cut together to articulate a point of view.

194
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,890
Just as there’s very little “reality”
in reality TV, so Vertov’s documentaries

195
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:37,060
are simply a different use of the magic trick
of film.

196
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:41,640
As power shifted to Stalin, western films
began to pour back into the U.S.S.R., and

197
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,330
film stock became more readily available.

198
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:46,760
And the government cooled on the esoteric
Soviet Montage filmmakers.

199
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,480
Audiences wanted something more accessible,
more emotional.

200
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,010
Socialist Realism, which began as a movement
in literature, became the state-supported

201
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,269
style of cinema.

202
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:57,230
Filmmakers were told to focus on realistic
stories that supported communist values.

203
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:00,550
A sort of propaganda-through-relatability,
rather than abstract theory.

204
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:03,790
A prime example of this is the 1935 film Youth
of Maxim.

205
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:07,680
The story follows a naive, young factory worker
in pre-Revolutionary Russia who helps his

206
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,230
colleagues hide a subversive teacher from
the police.

207
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:14,240
Over the course of the film, the young man
is radicalized and eventually joins the Revolution.

208
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,370
Rather than use jarring cuts and juxtaposition,
the film relies on a much more smooth, mainstream

209
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:21,811
style, encouraging viewers to identify with
the character and buy into the reality of

210
00:11:21,811 --> 00:11:22,811
the story.

211
00:11:22,811 --> 00:11:24,519
That brought an end to the Soviet Montage
movement.

212
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:27,890
As often happens, however, the techniques
developed by the Soviet Montage filmmakers

213
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:31,700
continue to influence cinema to this day,
in everything from the shower scene in Psycho,

214
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,200
to the latest music video.

215
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,370
And movie trailers… pretty much all the
movie trailers.

216
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:39,000
Today we learned how the Russian Revolution
led to a subsequent revolution in cinema.

217
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,850
We talked about how the Soviet Montage filmmakers
believed editing was the most foundational

218
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,170
element of film technique.

219
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:48,110
We looked at some of the filmmakers who put
those theories into practice, and how their

220
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,260
films worked as state-sponsored propaganda.

221
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:54,019
Next time, we’ll cross back to Hollywood
to witness the Golden Silent Era and the rise

222
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:57,760
of the studio system – where movies were
made as art, entertainment, and commerce,

223
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,040
more often than political statements – as
the story of film continues.

224
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,839
Crash Course Film History is produced in association
with PBS Digital Studios.

225
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:08,460

227
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,350
