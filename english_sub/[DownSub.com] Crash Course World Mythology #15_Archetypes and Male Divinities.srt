00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,820
Hey there. I'm Mike Rugnetta. This is Crash Course Mythology and hey,  Thoth, can we talk man-to-man?

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,989
Man-to-God? Man-to-Ibis-and-sometimes-Baboon because today's episode is about

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:15,630
Mythological men and what unites them among different cultures. We've been talking about gods for months

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,799
But now we're going to look at them more theoretically and divide them into groups based on their

5
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:26,310
archetypal functions in myth. Grab your Papyrus, Thoth, so you can take notes. I promise it won't be rote.

6
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:40,470
We examined female divinity archetypes in the last two episodes and

7
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:48,000
mythologists have categorized male divinities into a similar set of archetypes. Across countless myths when male gods appear

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,809
It's usually in one of six

9
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:56,158
forms. Fathers and/or sons, kings and judges, saviors and sages, Shamans, Tricksters, and the lords of

10
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:00,509
destruction and just if you got excited about finally figuring out the name of your new death metal band,

11
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,010
I've got some bad news,

12
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:09,239
it's already taken so. So let's begin at the beginning with fathers and sons. We've talked about creation myths and divine families,

13
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,820
so you already know that in a lot of cases a son

14
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,729
overthrows his father to usurp his spot.

15
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:20,220
This can get pretty bloody and, as is the case with Uranus and Cronus and Zeus, can even involve

16
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,909
castration. One reason god-sons might be eager to topple their divine fathers is that these fathers are often

17
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:27,940
aloof

18
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:33,809
Especially in creation myths, it's common for all-Powerful father figures to live in the sky being all unapproachable

19
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:40,110
for their children. According to Scott Leonard and Michael McClure in patrifocal myths, all seek the father's love

20
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:44,759
and approval; all long for even a glimpse of his face;

21
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:50,729
and all live in terror of his wrath. You can just picture Apollo asking Zeus

22
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:54,328
if he'll come outside to like kick the soccer ball around - "Come on dad, please?"

23
00:01:54,869 --> 00:02:01,709
Meanwhile Zeus is just lightning-bolting things - he's busy working. In other myths, sons become symbols of their fathers attributes or

24
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:07,140
conduits for their father's knowledge and abilities. Take Odin and his sons Tyr and Balder;

25
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:14,160
they epitomize their father's bravery and wisdom respectively and Thor is a distillation of Odin's military and

26
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:19,049
reproductive power. We see something similar in a Korean myth about the heavenly ruler Hwaning.

27
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:27,119
Before any people exist on Earth, Hwaning teaches his son Hwanung the secrets of the heavenly kingdom and allows him to descend to Earth

28
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,899
to create a new society. The advice allows Hwanung to rule more effectively over the earth, and later

29
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,539
he passes the same wisdom on to the first man, Dangun, so that he can recreate the heavenly order

30
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,269
himself. Gods hate weeding,

31
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:47,280
but they love order. in Hwanung's transition from archetypal son to father,

32
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:54,239
marked by passing on knowledge to humans, he also embodies another male archetype: God as king or judge.

33
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:59,399
There's no clear reason why pantheons of gods would need to be organized like terrestrial governments

34
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:06,450
but there are countless myths where gods are in human leadership roles. For instance, sky gods like Zeus are often described as

35
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:11,009
reigning like Kings and also partying like kings, if you ask Leticia,

36
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:18,720
Roman goddess of festivity. Historically, myths featuring gods as kings have helped justify monarchical  power on Earth. They create an

37
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,379
equivalence between the

38
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:28,048
terrestrial kings' ability to provide security and the gods' ability to do the same. In some traditions male divinities also act as judges; often

39
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:32,129
judges of human souls. In Egyptian myths, Osiris and

40
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:39,690
42 other gods test the souls of the dead to see if they were Maat Kheru, or true of voice. At times

41
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:47,099
Osiris and Anubis are pictured weighing a soul in the form of a heart against a feather and Thoth would record the results.

42
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:53,009
Nice work, pal. No matter how well a human has learned from their father figure, sometimes things get out of hand.

43
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:57,869
Mythology is brimming with stories of bailouts in the form of a savior god.

44
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,870
This salvation can be a

45
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:06,839
sacrifice like the Aztec myth of Nanahuatl who throws himself onto a fire to become the sun that will nourish

46
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:10,048
humanity - more on that in our episode about dying gods.

47
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:17,699
More often though gods act as saviors by providing knowledge and guidance that humans need to thrive spiritually and

48
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,839
survive actually.

49
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:27,000
Usually these saviors don't die, but instead impart some important, often sacred, knowledge that if followed leads to salvation.

50
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,120
We can make a case for

51
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,929
Prometheus, who gives people fire, as a kind of sage and maybe we can read the biblical story of Jesus as a

52
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,539
combination of savior and sage; just two great tastes that taste great together.

53
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,039
According to William Doty,

54
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:47,069
the Shaman is a figure who can enter the world of spirits easily because of the powers granted to her or him

55
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,809
by such beings. Often a Shaman will travel to spiritual realms,

56
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,140
journeying on a road that puts him in contact with supernatural

57
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:02,489
forces that most people cannot see. It can be tricky to see shamans as gods rather than human heroes because

58
00:05:02,829 --> 00:05:06,569
human Shamans exists in many cultures, both historically and

59
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:12,839
currently. It may be more helpful to think of some gods as having the skills or attributes of Shamans,

60
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:14,529
specifically the use of

61
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:17,879
supernatural power to provide or find the answers to

62
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:25,259
pressing questions. For example, the Celtic deity the Dagda has a magic cauldron from which he draws special items;

63
00:05:25,719 --> 00:05:30,178
messenger gods like Hermes sprint between the Earth, the Heavens and the Underworld.

64
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:32,689
Hermes himself was the God of alchemists and

65
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:40,229
magicians and, functionally similar to Hermes, is our good friend Thoth. Thoth was also a heavenly messenger, often credited with special if not

66
00:05:40,749 --> 00:05:42,898
mystical knowledge about things like

67
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:50,849
mathematics, astronomy, the alphabet and writing: that's why Thoth here is the patron god of Crash Course; not because his name is fun to say,

68
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:53,278
but because he's awesome. High five, pal.

69
00:05:53,829 --> 00:06:00,419
Another important archetypal role for male gods is the trickster. This one is so fun that we're going to be devoting a few episodes to

70
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,788
it in the future. We've already seen tricksters like Eshu,

71
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:06,479
who you may remember from our episode on Orishas, and of course our old friend

72
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,758
Loki, who you may remember from him being the worst.

73
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:14,729
Trickster gods remind us that life's can be chaotic, and not just the creation from the void kind of chaotic.

74
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:17,818
There's plenty of mischief that we're going to talk about; you're going to have to wait. Our last

75
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:21,959
archetype of male divinity is the Lord of Destruction, or Lord of the Underworld.

76
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:28,169
We've met this type before: Hades, Osiris looking at y'all's. Often they have dogs or dog-headed

77
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:34,438
gods as helpers, like Cerberus and Anubis, and sometimes lords of the underworld are connected with greed:

78
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:42,208
Pluto gives us the word plutocrat: someone who derives their power from their wealth; possibly because kings of the underworld never give up a soul

79
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:47,009
once they get one. Another possible explanation for the strange connection between death and abundance

80
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:50,818
is that some of these gods are linked with seasonal renewal and thus

81
00:06:51,339 --> 00:06:57,238
fertility, and it's not surprising that many gods of battle are archetypically male. A good example of a battle

82
00:06:57,239 --> 00:07:04,828
god who combines many masculine divine attributes is Perune, the chief Slavic deity. He sometimes pictured as a huge man with a

83
00:07:05,409 --> 00:07:11,609
silver face, a golden moustache and who wields an enormous club, a battle ax, a bow and arrow and

84
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:15,959
thunderbolts; basically, you name it, he is going to stab someone with it. And then there's Balor,

85
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,269
the celtic war god of the Fomorians.

86
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:22,530
His single eye has a lid so heavy that it required

87
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:27,269
servants to hoist it open which is probably a good thing because anyone who fell under

88
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:31,500
Balor of the stout blow's gaze was crushed in an instant.

89
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:37,949
Talk about a death stare. So as you've probably figured out, there's a lot of overlap among these archetypes. A male

90
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:41,878
god can be a king and a sage and a father and a warrior all at the same time

91
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:47,459
or he can fulfill different roles in different stories. A great example of this is the god Krishna in the

92
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:53,400
Bhagavad-Gita. The Bhagavad-Gita is the sixth book in the Indian epic poem the Mahabharata; in the West,

93
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,229
it's probably the most well known section of the poem. It tells the story of the Prince Arjuna and his

94
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,689
charioteer, who happens to be Krishna, deciding what to do on the battlefield of Kuruksetra.

95
00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:10,919
Thought bubble's is going to help us out. In the middle of battle, Prince Arjuna is torn between his duty as a warrior and

96
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:17,098
family loyalty. He has family on the opposite side, so he might harm them if he fulfilled his warrior Dharma.

97
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:23,819
He's deciding whether to be a warrior or renounce his role as a Kshatriya: a member of the Hindu military caste.

98
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:25,259
He says to Krishna, "Krishna,

99
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:30,509
I see my kinsmen gathered here, wanting war. My limbs sink, my mouth is parched,

100
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:37,288
my body trembles, the hair bristles on my flesh, the magic bow slips from my hand, my skin burns,

101
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:42,839
I cannot stand still, my mind reels. I see omens of chaos, Krishna;

102
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:47,219
I see no good in killing my kinsmen in battle." Krishna acts as a sage;

103
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,850
he answers Arjuna's question then gives him the secret to living a good life,

104
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:54,569
achieving immortality, and even becoming a sage himself.

105
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,649
He says, "You must learn to endure fleeting things - they come and go!

106
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,089
When these cannot torment a man, when suffering and joy are equal for him

107
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:10,109
and he has courage, he is fit for immortality." Then Arjuna asks to see Krishna in his true form. He is

108
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:11,290
duly

109
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:18,750
terrified and amazed. He says, "You are the gods of wind, death, fire and water; the moon; the lord of life; the great

110
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:25,919
ancestor... You are father of the world of animate and inanimate things, its venerable teacher, most worthy of worship...

111
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,019
I bow to you." Arjuna realizes

112
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:31,799
he must fulfill his destiny to be a warrior.

113
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:38,159
Krishna, by embodying various archetypes, helps Arjuna to become the best and most destructive

114
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:40,290
version of himself. Thanks

115
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:46,620
Thought bubble. So it's interesting that even while Krishna is ultimately encouraging Arjuna to rejoin the battle,

116
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:52,409
he's also offering a way to achieve peace and salvation within the religious tradition of Hinduism.

117
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,969
Krishna even provides more than one path, inspiring Arjuna to follow his dharma,

118
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:04,199
practice the disciplines of Yoga and worship Krishna himself, a devotion called Bhakti. When Krishna reveals himself to Arjuna,

119
00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:09,389
he is both creator and lord of destruction, glorious and terrible to behold.

120
00:10:09,819 --> 00:10:12,599
He represents the multiplicity and complexity of

121
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,690
divinity, common in Indian religious texts and

122
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:16,690
myths.

123
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:17,440
He is

124
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,459
lord and father,

125
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:25,018
but also provides comfort like a friend or a lover, and he's a sage too when he provides a path to salvation.

126
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,709
So really Krishna's pretty much the full God package. The fact that Krishna occupies almost every archetype

127
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:33,189
we've talked about helps illustrate

128
00:10:33,189 --> 00:10:34,600
what's useful about

129
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,319
identifying

130
00:10:35,319 --> 00:10:42,929
archetypes in the first place. Knowing about these categories allows us to see patterns in stories and even whole traditions. Realizing that father

131
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:49,720
figures take different forms in different cultures or often take the same form helps us ground the connections between myth,

132
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:57,540
culture and our beliefs about everyday life and what it means to be a dude. Thanks for watching we'll see you next week.

Egyptian Mythology.
