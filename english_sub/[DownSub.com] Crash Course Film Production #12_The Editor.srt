1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,060
A movie, as you know, is basically a sequence
of shots.

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,490
The shots themselves may be beautiful or strange,
kinetic or still, bright or dark.

3
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,099
And, viewed individually, they might carry
some meaning.

4
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:17,140
But the real power of narrative cinema comes
when you put those shots together.

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,480
Suddenly they have context.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,850
They react to one another, surprising us or
putting us at ease.

7
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,779
Cut together, these shots can create whole
new levels of meaning and evoke emotions in

8
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:27,100
ways only cinema can.

9
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,830
And the person whose job it is to make those
cuts, to discover that emotional and narrative

10
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,220
alchemy, is… the editor.

11
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:46,280
[Intro Music Plays]

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,460
Like cinematographers, production designers,
costumers, and makeup artists, editors must

13
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,070
be part technician, part craftsperson, and
part creative artist.

14
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,780
They are responsible for understanding the
technology of post-production, from editing

15
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,940
software to integrating sound design, music,
and special effects.

16
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:05,650
But they also need to have a deep understanding
of film grammar, a gut instinct for character,

17
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:06,930
and a powerful sense of timing.

18
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,060
They are the final guardians of the story
and the emotional landscape of the film.

19
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:15,780
A narrative film is a very fragile thing,
and one misplaced cut can drastically change

20
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,780
its meaning and impact.

21
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,610
But as crucial as it is, the editor’s job
is also to hide their work.

22
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,030
Usually, their goal is to make the cuts appear
so seamless that the audience doesn’t even

23
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,030
notice them at all.

24
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:28,520
Like so many great artists, the best editors
make their work look effortless.

25
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,900
But trust me, it’s not!

26
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,930
Among their duties, editors must be able to
sort through hours and hours of raw footage

27
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,570
to find the story.

28
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:39,590
They must train their visual memories to remember
tiny differences between takes and shots,

29
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,160
and imagine how they might be cut together.

30
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,370
They must help the director separate the movie
they wanted to make, from the movie they

31
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,390
actually shot.

32
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,281
They are fresh eyes, unencumbered by the challenges
of getting a shot or the heartbreak of a performance

33
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:51,281
that didn’t turn out.

34
00:01:51,281 --> 00:01:55,530
Editors must also have the taste to recognize
when the story isn’t working, and the skills

35
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,630
and experience to offer some solutions.

36
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,000
Another way to think of this is that editors
are the first audience for a film.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,220
An audience with the power to change it and
make it even better.

38
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,220
So how do they do it?

39
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:08,389
In the beginning, editors worked with razor
blades and tape to physically slice the film

40
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,239
into shots and then join those shots together.

41
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,140
It was painstaking work.

42
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,580
One cut could take several minutes, as opposed
to the seconds it takes today using editing software.

43
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,800
It was also more difficult to experiment with
various cuts.

44
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,990
There was no easy, quick way to go back and
undo a particular edit.

45
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,870
Just more razor blades, tape, and time.

46
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,610
An editing machine called a Moviola became
standard equipment for editors in the 1920s,

47
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,700
and not a moment too soon!

48
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:35,120
In addition to streamlining the process, the
Movila allowed editors to watch the film as

49
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,480
they were making their cuts.

50
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,760
Then in the 1970s, flatbed editing systems
like the Steenbeck and the KEM arrived.

51
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,920
Now editors could move the film backward and
forward to examine their edits, and listen

52
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,090
to the recorded soundtrack as they went.

53
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:51,280
Flatbeds would remain the industry standard
until the 1990s, when digital editing systems

54
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,530
like the Avid emerged.

55
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,980
We refer to physical film editing as linear
editing, because the process involves editing

56
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,590
your way through the scene or the film in
sequence, shot by shot, and choosing cut points

57
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,590
as you go.

58
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,540
It’s also called destructive editing, since
the editor is literally cutting the film,

59
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,260
irreparably altering it with each transition
between shots.

60
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:13,720
When you edit digitally using computer software,
that process is called non-linear editing.

61
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,790
Here, you can scroll to any point in the scene,
or in the film, with the touch of a button,

62
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,730
joining and re-joining shots in any order,
as many times as you want.

63
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,510
It’s also called non-destructive editing.

64
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:27,780
The main non-linear editing systems include
the Avid, Apple’s Final Cut Pro, and Adobe Premiere.

65
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,940
Each system has its benefits and drawbacks,
and each editor must figure out what works

66
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,490
best for each project in terms of budget,
workflow, and ease of use.

67
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:39,129
Now, when the footage comes in from the set,
the editor’s first step is to create an

68
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:40,129
assembly cut.

69
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:43,790
This is a very rough version of the movie
that cuts each scene together in its most

70
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,790
basic form.

71
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,090
They’re often very long and sometimes contain
multiple takes of a given shot.

72
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,480
The goal of the assembly cut is for the director
and editor to see if they’ve captured the story.

73
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,560
Are there any major plot points missing?

74
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:57,260
Can the desired tone be achieved with the
footage that they have?

75
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,319
Are there any technical problems with the
footage?

76
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:01,220
Do the characters make sense?

77
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,370
Where are the plot holes?

78
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,410
Watching an assembly cut for the first time
is often both a joyful and painful experience.

79
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:10,610
There’s your film, all put together, coming
alive for the first time before your eyes.

80
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:15,239
But it’s also usually a Frankenstein’s
monster of dead-ends, missed shots, and performances

81
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:17,048
that haven’t been properly paced yet!

82
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,048
But don’t panic!

83
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:19,048
Because there’s more work to do!

84
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:22,800
The next step in the process is to make a
rough cut, or several of them.

85
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,990
This is the time for experimentation, for
re-thinking the structure of the film.

86
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,469
What if this scene goes here?

87
00:04:27,469 --> 00:04:28,469
What if we move this line to the next scene?

88
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:31,099
Do we even need this this subplot, or this
moment, or this shot?

89
00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:34,939
How can we build the tension, liven a flat
scene, or make a joke funnier?

90
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:39,009
The editor uses rough cuts to focus on the
bigger parts of the movie that aren’t working.

91
00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:42,589
It’s also where the filmmakers can begin
to get a sense of what the ultimate run time

92
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:43,620
of the movie will be.

93
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,949
Once those issues have been solved, the editor
moves on to the fine cut.

94
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:49,830
At this point, the issues are smaller, but
no less significant.

95
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:55,700
It’s time to fine tune performances, maximize
emotional impact, trim some shots, and extend others.

96
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,260
This is where you ask: When do we cut from
one character or another?

97
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,930
Is it better to extend this shot by one frame?

98
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,069
Two frames?

99
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,069
Five?

100
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:06,520
How can we hide our crappy, animatronic shark?

101
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,600
Two frames can make the difference between Jaws and Sharknado.

102
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,000
Then we come to the final cut.

103
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:14,710
At this point we are achieving a “locked
cut,” meaning no more changes to the duration

104
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,479
or order of any shot in the film.

105
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,349
Color correction is happening.

106
00:05:18,349 --> 00:05:19,830
Visual and sound effects are coming in.

107
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,779
Music is being composed, recorded, and selected.

108
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:27,259
ADR, or automated dialogue replacement, is
being recorded and added to the film.

109
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:31,979
And it’s all being mixed so that every image
and sound in the film exists in proper balance,

110
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,540
fulfilling the vision of the director, who’s
now working through the editor and

111
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,480
the post-production team.

112
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,020
Each step in this process is specific and
important, but not necessarily distinct.

113
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:44,259
Every film is different, so often these stages
blend into one another.

114
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:48,470
The editor might have a brilliant re-structuring
idea in the fine cut stage, and open the film

115
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,939
back up to re-arrange some scenes.

116
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:54,469
Or the director might have a sudden desire
to extend a pivotal emotional beat just as

117
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:55,629
the film is locking picture.

118
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:58,940
However it happens, once all these steps are
complete, so is the movie.

119
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:03,740
And at every step in this process, the editor
makes an indelible mark on the project … even

120
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:05,069
if it’s not always obvious.

121
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:09,749
One of the most powerful effects of the editor’s
work is the ability to shift a film’s perspective.

122
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:14,400
Who the film cuts to, at what moment, and
how long it remains on a character can influence

123
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,990
the audience’s identification with a character
and their experience.

124
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:22,620
Editors spend a lot of time asking questions
like, “Whose scene is this?” and “Why?”

125
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,779
Usually followed by, “Does it have to
be that way?” and “What if we tried it

126
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:27,110
from another point of view?”

127
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,719
Very often the director is in the room for
these conversations, and if they can be open

128
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:34,919
to it, an editor’s ideas can sometimes change
the way they think of the film, opening up

129
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:36,430
new and exciting possibilities.

130
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:40,069
The more films you make, the more you realize
that you can’t separate shooting and editing.

131
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:41,279
They’re bound together.

132
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,240
The shots inform the editing and allow for
all the experimentation that is to come.

133
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,869
Cinematographers spend a lot of their own
prep time thinking and talking about how their

134
00:06:48,869 --> 00:06:50,009
shots might get cut together.

135
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:53,659
It’s all designed to tell the story and
evoke the desired emotions.

136
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:56,110
And so much of it comes down to when to
cut.

137
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:00,139
And how the rhythm of those cuts contributes
to the emotional and narrative experience

138
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:01,139
of the story.

139
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:05,760
The best editors collaborate very closely
with directors and bring out the best in their work.

140
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,080
The great Thelma Schoonmaker has been editing
Martin Scorsese films since the earliest days

141
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:14,120
of his career, from the split-second cuts
of Raging Bull to the contemplative stillness

142
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,189
of Silence.

143
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:20,160
Stephen Spielberg has worked with editor Michael
Kahn ever since Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

144
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:24,659
Quentin Tarantino has long praised the late
Sally Menke for corralling his impulses and

145
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:28,229
bringing order to his films, from Reservoir
Dogs to Inglorious Basterds.

146
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:30,720
Walter Murch is one of the editing greats.

147
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,169
He’s cut everything from Apocalypse Now
and The Godfather to The English Patient.

148
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:38,759
He was among the first old-guard editors to
switch to a non-linear editing system, and

149
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,250
he wrote the book on film editing, called
In the Blink of an Eye.

150
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:46,639
In it, he lays out his six priorities for
cutting away from one shot to another.

151
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,389
The first is emotion.

152
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:50,849
How does the shot affect the audience emotionally?

153
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:52,169
What do you want them to feel?

154
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:54,720
And does a cut add to that emotion, or take
away from it?

155
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,439
The second is story.

156
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,499
Does the cut move the story forward?

157
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,320
Each cut needs to advance the story, not bog
it down.

158
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,920
Murch’s third priority is rhythm.

159
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:34,100
Just like music, he believes editing must
have a beat, a rhythm, a sense of phrasing.

160
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,070
Is a cut interesting here, or dull?

161
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,770
What does it do to the pacing of a scene?

162
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:38,770
Shake it up?

163
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:39,600
Or flatten it?

164
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,100
Fourth is something he calls eye trace.

165
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,080
How does the cut affect where the audience
focuses in the frame?

166
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,520
The editor should be aware of where they want
the audience to be looking, and then use that

167
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,680
to surprise or confirm their instincts, depending
on what the scene is trying to accomplish.

168
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:25,640
The last two priorities charge the editor
with being aware of both the two dimensional

169
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,910
place of the screen as well as three dimensional
space.

170
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:33,180
These are fancy ways of saying the cut has
the power to maintain or disorient the audience

171
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,160
as to the physical space within the scene.

172
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,330
All told, the editor should be conscious of
how the cut affects the audience’s understanding

173
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,480
of the world of the film.

174
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,920
Editors are as vital to the filmmaking process
as they are low profile.

175
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,130
By the time the film is screening in a theater,
no one knows the footage, the emotional beats,

176
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:07,000
the pacing, and the performances better than
the editor.

177
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,060
Without them, we’d just have a pile of random
footage.

178
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,880
With them, we have magic.

179
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,240
Today we talked about the job of the editor,
as both a technician and an artist.

180
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,700
We learned about the history of film editing,
from hand-cutting film to using digital editing software.

181
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,880
And we explored the impact of the choices
an editor makes in collaboration with the

182
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,860
director, and how those cuts can bring a film
to life.

183
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,870
Next time we’ll explore marketing, the surprisingly
creative work done after the film is edited,

184
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,770
as distributors try to pitch the film to its
intended audience.

185
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:40,060
Crash Course Film Production is produced in
association with PBS Digital Studios.

186
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,561
You can head over to their channel to check
out a playlist of their latest shows, like

187
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:47,840
PBS Infinite Series, PBS Space Time, and It’s
Okay to be Smart.

188
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,780
This episode of Crash Course was filmed in
the Doctor Cheryl C. Kinney Crash Course Studio

189
00:10:51,780 --> 00:00:00,000
with the help of these nice people and our
amazing graphics team is Thought Cafe.
