1
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:07,840
Mainstream American films don’t often tackle
race and racism head-on, and when they do,

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,110
they often end up trying to find easy answers.

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,710
Which makes films like Spike Lee’s Do the
Right Thing all the more powerful.

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,019
It’s an intimate portrait of a Brooklyn
neighborhood, with a vibrant, intergenerational,

5
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:19,380
multi-ethnic community.

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:25,119
But it also has an explosive climax, fueled
by racial resentments, economic anxiety, and

7
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,480
rising tensions on the hottest day of the
year.

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,299
Lee uses an incredible array of filmmaking
techniques to make audiences think and engage.

9
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:36,960
And the issues he’s wrestling with are still
very much alive today, more than 25 years later.

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:49,640
[intro music plays]

11
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,450
Do the Right Thing burst onto screens in 1989,

12
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,390
after electrifying audiences and polarizing
critics at the Cannes Film Festival.

13
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:01,480
At the time, writer-director Spike Lee was
just 32 and had made only two feature films

14
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,680
– the sly, sexy She’s Gotta Have It and
School Daze, a comedy set at an all-black

15
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,680
Southern college.

16
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,130
Lee began conceiving Do the Right Thing with
his cinematographer Ernest Dickerson as they

17
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,670
were finishing work on School Daze.

18
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,950
He was partially inspired by an incident in
1986 in which Michael Griffith, a 23-year-old

19
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,240
African-American, was beaten up and chased
from an Italian-American pizzeria, only to

20
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,119
be killed by an oncoming car.

21
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,840
Having grown up in Brooklyn, steeped in the
complex lives and racial politics of its residents,

22
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,520
Lee wanted to make a film that captured that
world.

23
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,590
The story of Do the Right Thing takes place
almost completely over one blistering day

24
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,539
in the Bedford-Stuyvesant
neighborhood of Brooklyn.

25
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:41,810
Rather than following one traditional protagonist,
this film follows a variety of characters

26
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,539
as they try to beat the heat, make a living,
take a stand, or just get by.

27
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:47,399
It’s a film about community.

28
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,560
Spike Lee plays Mookie, a young African-American
man who delivers pizzas for Sal’s Famous

29
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,159
Pizzeria, a neighborhood hangout.

30
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,760
And it’s through Mookie and the restaurant
that we’re introduced to most of the other characters.

31
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,480
There’s Sal himself, a proud Italian-American
played by Danny Aiello.

32
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:04,460
He works with his two sons, the aggressive
Pino, played by John Turturro, and the more

33
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,619
passive Vito, played by Richard Edson.

34
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:11,340
Then there’s Da Mayor, played by the legendary
Ossie Davis, a kind of elder statesman and

35
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,690
alcoholic who wanders the streets trying to
keep the peace.

36
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:18,890
Mirroring that, there’s Mother Sister – played
by Ruby Dee, Davis’s real-life wife – who

37
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,000
keeps a watchful eye on the neighborhood from
her open apartment window.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,480
Mookie runs into friends throughout the day,
from Giancarlo Esposito’s politically outspoken

39
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,570
Buggin’ Out, to Bill Nunn’s Radio Raheem,
who carries around the world’s biggest ghetto-blaster,

40
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,200
cranking Public Enemy’s hip-hop anthem “Fight
the Power.”

41
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,640
Woven through the story is Smiley, a developmentally
delayed man played by Roger Guenveur Smith,

42
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,410
who makes a few dollars here and there
selling a photo of Malcolm X and Dr. Martin

43
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,410
Luther King, Jr.

44
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:48,570
And overlooking the whole thing is a smooth-voiced
radio DJ played by Samuel L. Jackson.

45
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:52,710
He not only spins tunes, but also watches
the day unfold from his window, calling out

46
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,570
to characters as they pass his studio.

47
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,200
Beyond the Italian-American and African-American
characters, there’s a grocery store run

48
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,220
by a Korean couple, a group of Latino kids,
and Mookie’s girlfriend Tina, played by

49
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,220
Rosie Perez.

50
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,170
There’s also one white yuppie, who signifies
the coming gentrification of the neighborhood.

51
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,480
And, finally, a pair of white New York City
policemen patrol the streets in a squad car.

52
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,870
All of these characters and their plots keep
interweaving throughout the day, leading to

53
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:19,640
a climactic showdown that ends with a riot,
Radio Raheem dead from a police chokehold,

54
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,920
Sal’s Famous Pizzeria in flames, and everyone
trying to find a way forward.

55
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,970
This film, like many films, is all about emotion
and visual communication.

56
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:32,570
Lee, his cinematographer, and production designer
worked tirelessly to create a mood and the

57
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,320
sense of a ticking bomb.

58
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,720
So looking at this film is a great way to
understand how cinema affects an audience.

59
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,850
One of the things Lee does to ratchet the
tension and immerse us in this very specific

60
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,480
world is to emphasize how hot it is.

61
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,790
And he uses all kinds of filmmaking techniques
to do it.

62
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:50,690
Not only does the cinematography highlight
the blasting rays of the sun, but Lee had

63
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:55,130
production designer Wynn Thomas remove all
the blues and greens he could from the costumes,

64
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,430
props, sets, and make-up.

65
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:01,540
Instead, the film is a feast of warm colors:
vibrant reds, oranges, and yellows.

66
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,571
Lee and Dickerson even put heat lamps right
under the camera lens in some shots to produce

67
00:04:05,571 --> 00:04:07,360
those wavy heat shimmers.

68
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,390
Characters are routinely covered in sweat.

69
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,220
Their clothes stick to their bodies.

70
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,820
And their tempers are set on a hair trigger,
just waiting to be ignited.

71
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,649
Lee mixes all kinds of filmmaking styles,
mirroring the way the block mixes cultural

72
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:19,649
identities.

73
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:23,720
The movie begins with an heavily-stylized,
color-saturated dance sequence that plays

74
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,870
during the opening credits.

75
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,100
In it, Rosie Perez dances alone to “Fight
the Power.”

76
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,170
This is the film asserting its agenda right
up front, both stylistic and musical.

77
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:36,120
It’s a challenge, but it’s also fun and
exciting, just like the rest of the film.

78
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,160
Lee makes excellent use of wide tracking shots
as characters move from one part of the block

79
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,160
to another.

80
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,210
These shots feel expansive and natural, and
yet they’re clearly highly choreographed.

81
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:48,310
He’ll have minor characters move through
the background or step in at the end of a

82
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,980
scene to redirect the story.

83
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:54,600
That kind of meandering is actually really
hard to pull off, and the work here is seamless.

84
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,660
It underlines the interconnectedness of the
film’s community.

85
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,340
At other times, Lee and Dickerson will tilt
the camera 45 degrees in what’s often called

86
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,420
a Dutch or canted angle.

87
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,760
Suddenly, the horizon line isn’t flat and
the world feels unstable and off-kilter.

88
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,810
It’s almost as if the characters are in
danger of falling out of the screen because

89
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,420
their world is so off balance.

90
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,910
In one of the film’s most powerful sequences,
Lee even has his characters look directly

91
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,440
into the camera, breaking the fourth wall.

92
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,740
And they unleash the most profane string of
ethnic and racial insults in the film.

93
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,540
As the film critic Thomas Doherty writes in
Film Quarterly:

94
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:34,169
“The interethnic, interracial animosity
explodes in a montage of face-front slurs...that

95
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:36,470
serve as warm-ups for the ultimate bonfire.”

96
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:40,650
All this anger and resentment simmering below
the surface prepares us for the eruption that’s

97
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,650
about to come.

98
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,370
It also adds another dimension to a film about
community.

99
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:49,430
Because this community, however harmonious
it may seem, is deeply, perhaps irrevocably,

100
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,430
fractured.

101
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,700
The film echoes this fracturing by shifting
tones and moods.

102
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,090
Scenes will go from light-hearted and funny
to tense at the drop of a hat.

103
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:01,860
In one sequence, kids from the neighborhood
open a fire hydrant and cool off in the spraying water.

104
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,840
All the tensions dissolve for a while as people
start dragging their friends in to get soaked.

105
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,120
It’s a glorious free-for-all!

106
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,610
And suddenly, this carefully-choreographed,
stylized film seems to take the approach of

107
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:12,610
a documentary.

108
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:17,060
It’s as though Lee set the action in motion
and is just capturing it as it happens.

109
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,870
The freedom of the camera mirrors the freedom
of the characters.

110
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:24,110
Then, a middle-aged Italian-American drives
a beautifully-maintained convertible up the

111
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,110
street.

112
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,840
He threatens the kids not to spray him as
he passes.

113
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,320
And not in a nice way, either!

114
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,610
As the insults fly back and forth, and the
tension returns, Lee and Dickerson lock their

115
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,820
camera down again.

116
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,070
And sure enough, when the man drives past
the hydrant, the kids turn the water loose,

117
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,940
dousing both him and the car.

118
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:45,400
The man storms out of his car, the kids run,
and the cops show up, shutting off the hydrant,

119
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,400
and ending the fun.

120
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,560
The shifting moods of Do the Right Thing are
a large part of its power.

121
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,170
The film keeps us unsure about which encounters
are going to lead to trouble and which ones

122
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,280
are going to end in humor.

123
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,240
In the lighter moments, we empathize with
the community.

124
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,870
We don’t want to see it torn apart.

125
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,770
At one point, Radio Raheem faces off against
a group of Latino kids who are playing their

126
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,110
own music from a slightly smaller boom box.

127
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:08,560
When Radio Raheem cranks his volume to the
max, the other kids nod sheepishly, conceding

128
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,710
that Radio Raheem’s speakers can’t be
beat.

129
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,510
And this moment is more than just a funny
gag.

130
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,770
That ghetto blaster means something.

131
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:18,449
When Radio Raheem cranks it up, he’s not
only demonstrating his machine’s power,

132
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:22,670
he’s also asserting his cultural identity
and the coming dominance of hip-hop.

133
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:26,710
And in fact, the final confrontation that
ends with Radio Raheem’s death and the destruction

134
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:30,710
of the pizzeria escalates when Sal demands
Radio Raheem turn down his music.

135
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,850
This time, instead of ending with a laugh,
Lee flips the script and has Sal smash the

136
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,370
ghetto blaster to bits, bringing on the killing
and the riot.

137
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,889
Critics and scholars have been debating the
film and its ultimate stance on race and racism

138
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:42,890
since it was released.

139
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:47,620
Film critic David Denby initially labeled
the film incoherent and irresponsible.

140
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,770
Political columnist Joe Klein even warned
that the movie might spark actual riots.

141
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:54,870
Roger Ebert, on the other hand, strongly disagreed,
writing:

142
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:58,639
“Thoughtless people have accused Lee … of
being an angry filmmaker.

143
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,080
He has much to be angry about, but I don't
find it in his work.

144
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,140
The wonder of “Do the Right Thing” is
that he is so fair.

145
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:08,650
Those who found this film an incitement to
violence are saying much about themselves,

146
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,230
and nothing useful about the movie.

147
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:14,009
Whatever its stance, Do the Right
Thing is an unapologetically political film.

148
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:18,419
It wrestles very explicitly with two strands
of black activism, and what those two approaches

149
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:20,169
mean for the community as a whole.

150
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:24,800
There’s peaceful direct action, as advocated
by Martin Luther King, Jr., and a more militant

151
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,980
strain, most often associated with Malcolm
X.

152
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,800
The film presents us with characters on all
sides of this divide, from Buggin’ Out,

153
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,789
who tries to organize a boycott of Sal’s
pizzeria, to Mookie, who just wants to get

154
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:36,309
through his day and get paid.

155
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:40,038
Outside of the black community, we have everything
from the obvious racial antagonism of the

156
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:44,580
Italian-American in his convertible, to Sal,
who begins the film with a kind gesture toward

157
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,320
Da Mayor, despite the objections of his own
son, Pino.

158
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,260
By the end of the film, though, Sal is revealed
to be a much less sympathetic character.

159
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,640
His stubborn refusal to add photos of African-Americans
to his “Wall of Fame” and his destruction

160
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,760
of Radio Raheem’s boom box led directly
to violence.

161
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:04,150
Not only that, but Sal destroys the boom box
with a worn baseball bat, itself a heavy

162
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:08,610
symbol of violence against African-Americans,
including in the incident with Michael Griffith.

163
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,490
Some scholars point to this character as key
to Spike Lee’s strategy for engaging with

164
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:15,580
white audiences, especially when he’s tackling
racism.

165
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,590
In the journal Thinking Through Cinema: Film
as Philosophy, Dan Flory writes:

166
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:24,740
“Lee depicts sympathetic racist characters
so that viewers may initially forge positive

167
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:29,990
allegiances with them in spite of those characters’
anti-black beliefs and actions, which in earlier

168
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:33,970
stages of the narrative seem trivial ... or
may even go unnoticed.

169
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:38,140
He then alienates viewers from such characters
by revealing the harmfulness of these typically

170
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,839
white beliefs and actions.”

171
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,100
In other words, Lee’s choice to make Sal
sympathetic early in the film forces non-black

172
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,830
audiences to confront their own, perhaps deeply
buried, notions of race and racism – especially

173
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:54,160
as the story reaches its boiling point, and
Sal is revealed to be a much more harmful

174
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,160
character.

175
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,050
During the film’s climax, Mookie finds himself
sharing a shot with Sal and his sons as they

176
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,860
face down Buggin’ Out, Radio Raheem, and
Smiley.

177
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,730
He’s on one side of the divide.

178
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:07,730
Only after Radio Raheem has been killed by
the police does he signal that he’s had

179
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:12,490
enough, crossing the street, emptying a garbage
can, and then hurling it through the window

180
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,490
of Sal’s restaurant.

181
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,149
Did Mookie do the right thing?

182
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:19,420
A more traditional film about race may have
ended there, suggesting triumph in his revenge.

183
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,940
But Spike Lee isn’t interested in declaring
right and wrong.

184
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,450
Remember, he’s making a film about a community.

185
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:30,080
And that community has to get up the next
day, sweep up the ashes, and find a way to

186
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,350
move forward.

187
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,610
And that’s exactly what happens.

188
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:38,640
It’s an uneasy ending, not traditionally
satisfying, but it feels very real and immediate.

189
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,550
These same difficult conversations about race,
violence, and community are as relevant to

190
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,070
our society today as they have ever been.

191
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:48,970
For Mookie, Sal, Spike Lee, and the rest of
us, the struggle continues.

192
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:51,430
Next time, we’ll look at Lost in Translation.

193
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:55,630
It’s a quieter, more contemplative film
about a lost young woman who strikes up a

194
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:59,260
friendship with an older, fading movie star
in contemporary Japan.

195
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:03,400
Crash Course Film Criticism is produced in
association with PBS Digital Studios.
