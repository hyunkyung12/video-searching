1
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:06,589
So, I have a script to work off of, to tell
you about directing.

2
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:08,630
But what do you think we should do in this
video?

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,670
Should I show you what a director does?

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,780
Should I explain everything a director does?

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,030
Should I try to get you to guess what a director
does?

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,460
People often assume that the director has
all the answers, but directors ask a lot of questions.

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,960
According to American Playwright and Filmmaker
David Mamet, directors only have two main

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,590
questions to ask themselves: What do I tell
the actors?

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,770
And where do I put the camera?

10
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,410
And that’s a cheeky way of encompassing
a lot of what the director should do.

11
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,340
But maybe a better way of looking at it is
that the director has a strong sense of where

12
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,829
the answers are buried, and their job is to
steer their team to where they can uncover

13
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:37,829
those answers.

14
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,710
That might sound a little foofy, but it’s
the clearest way I can describe what the job

15
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,710
of a director is.

16
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:45,940
A director must use everything at their disposal
to clearly communicate to their actors, their

17
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,100
crew, and ultimately to us, the audience.

18
00:00:48,100 --> 00:01:01,059
[Intro Music Plays]

19
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:03,679
A director’s job is to bring their vision
to life in the film.

20
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:07,960
So, a common misunderstanding is that the
actors are just like puppets, illustrating

21
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,960
the director’s ideas.

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,870
An actor’s job is to bring a character to
life.

23
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,750
And we need actors to think real thoughts
and feel real feelings to make the film relatable.

24
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,930
A good actor gives a director options, by
making informed choices about how a character

25
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,420
would act in the various situations that the
script puts them in.

26
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,190
We’ve talked about the language of the camera,
and how the way in which shots are framed

27
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,360
can help convey a story.

28
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,410
But the camera’s most important job is to
read the characters’ thoughts.

29
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,860
For that to happen, actors have to be vulnerable,
and think as the character.

30
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,030
This is incredibly demanding work, so it’s
up to the director to ensure that the actors

31
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,250
have a safe space to explore their characters
and take risks.

32
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,890
And the actor relies on the director to steer
them in the right direction.

33
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,150
I joked earlier about having you guess what
I would say in this video.

34
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:50,250
That’s because forcing an actor into a position
where they’re unsure about how to act in

35
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,680
a scene is one way to ruin their performance.

36
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,980
If an actor feels like they need to direct
themselves in a scene, they won’t risk

37
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,800
losing themselves in the world of the film,
and it’ll feel fake.

38
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,850
To give an actor the confidence they need
to inhabit a character, a director must give

39
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,320
clear, actionable directions.

40
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,320
What do I mean by that?

41
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,730
Well, let’s say we’re working on a scene
about a breakup.

42
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:12,330
A clear, actionable direction could be, "Since
your character has been blind-sighted by this

43
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,700
breakup, you want to keep the other person
from leaving the room so you can get answers."

44
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,351
The actor receiving this direction now knows
that their character has just learned that

45
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:22,360
they were wrong about the other character,
and they have a goal of keeping the other

46
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,360
person there.

47
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,850
They know where they’re coming from and
where they’re trying to go.

48
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:29,390
Now, no matter what happens in the scene,
this actor can feel confident in their decisions

49
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,670
if they’re working toward keeping the other
person in the room.

50
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:36,440
On the flip side of that, an unclear or non-actionable
direction in that breakup scene could be,

51
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,980
“You wish this wasn’t happening and it
reminds you of when your parents got divorced.”

52
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,420
How do you act “wishing” or “being reminded”
of something?

53
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,620
That’s way too vague.

54
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,060
But if the director knew what they wanted,
they could tell the actor something like,

55
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,140
“You see this person as the father who left
you when you were 10 and, just like then,

56
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,700
you’ll do anything to keep them here.”

57
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,150
So now this is a more actable note, because
our actor understands the power dynamic of

58
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,790
this relationship and knows that they’re
using the same tools a 10-year-old would.

59
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:06,040
And, most importantly, the actor now has a
goal: “Keep the other person from leaving.”

60
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,401
So the director has a plan for how they’d
like the scene to go, and the actors will

61
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:13,240
add their own interpretations to that, and
the hope is that they uncover the best possible scene.

62
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,060
It is possible for a director to get the scene
they envision without allowing the actors

63
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,880
to do their work, but this doesn’t build
trust or create the conditions for a better

64
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,209
film than the director is capable of imagining.

65
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:28,150
This is something author, and directing instructor
Judith Weston calls result-oriented directing,

66
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,520
and it’s a common mistake of new directors
who are focused on the surface-level aspects

67
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,270
of acting instead of the true work that goes
into it.

68
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,760
Instead of working with the actors to unpack
what the line means and what the purpose of

69
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,560
the scene is, a director will focus on outward
emoting and try to control how an actor does things.

70
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,180
You may have heard directions like, “On
that line, laugh.”

71
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,599
or “When you see her, you start to cry.”

72
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,849
This tells the actor nothing about what their
character is actually thinking and feeling.

73
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:53,870
A director might think they’re helping the
actor by telling them how they should say

74
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:58,240
the line or where they should put emphasis
in the line, but this is called a line reading,

75
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,680
and it limits the actor to just mimicking
the director rather than communicating what

76
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,000
the character is feeling.

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,310
A result-oriented direction will usually give
the director what they think they want in

78
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,410
that moment, but at a pretty high cost.

79
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,770
These directors are only paying attention
to what the characters look like outwardly

80
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,840
instead of what’s going on in their minds.

81
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,560
And when you’re working with a good actor
who’s thinking real thoughts, the camera

82
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,129
-- and therefore the audience -- can pick
up on those thoughts.

83
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,710
The result will be a deeper, more nuanced
performance than when the actor is just pantomiming

84
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,199
what the director tells them to do.

85
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,900
It’s important to remember that filmmaking
is collaborative by design, and while the

86
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:34,100
director is the creative leader, insisting
the film turn out exactly like the director

87
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,000
imagines it will severely limit the film.

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,410
Result-oriented directing can also break trust
that’s been built between director and actor.

89
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:44,180
After all, if a director can’t trust an
actor to experiment and discover what’s

90
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,840
needed from a scene, then why should the actor
trust the director?

91
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,850
The detrimental short-cut of line readings
can be avoided by making time for rehearsal.

92
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,030
And rehearsal is a great way for the director
and actors to build trust.

93
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,280
Some directors, like Sydney Lumet, are subtle
about it.

94
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,810
Lumet would tell each person where to sit
at the first read through of a script.

95
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:04,690
This made it clear to the actors that he had
a plan and was confident in his choices.

96
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:08,590
Directors like Mike Leigh, are more overt
about building trust in rehearsal.

97
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:12,300
Leigh purposely works with actors who are
willing to explore themes and ideas before

98
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,320
they even have a script.

99
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,010
They work through proposed scenes together,
and then Leigh develops a script around what

100
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,889
they’ve uncovered together in the rehearsal
process.

101
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:22,740
By the time the cameras are rolling, the actors
have been living and growing as these characters,

102
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,930
that they know how to approach every scene.

103
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,850
From rehearsal to the final cut, a director’s
job always includes guiding the actors in

104
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:32,919
their roles and shaping those performances,
but the director also works with every creative

105
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:33,949
department on a film.

106
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:37,820
That’s what Mamet calls “where to put
the camera,” but it involves much more than that.

107
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,540
Just like with the actors, the director has
to deeply understand the other departments

108
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,919
so they can communicate clearly with everyone.

109
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,360
During pre-production, the director coaches
the location scouts on what the film needs

110
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,360
in its setting.

111
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,620
They work with the Production Designer, set
decorators, and props department to build

112
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,100
the world and orchestrate everything in the
mise en scene.

113
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,960
And before the actors even get to set, the
director needs to understand the film’s

114
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,040
characters to communicate their personalities
and struggles to the costume designer.

115
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,890
Both before and during filming, the director
works with the Hair and MakeUp and special

116
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:07,800
effects departments to perfect the details
of the storytelling.

117
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,580
And yes, the director decides where to put
the camera.

118
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,889
There are an infinite number of ways to make
a shot look cool or beautiful, but there is

119
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:17,620
usually one best way to shoot a scene when
you remember that every shot should be motivated

120
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,229
by what the scene is trying to convey.

121
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:22,520
What’s motivating the camera placement and
movement can be practical -- like, if you

122
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,620
need to show someone driving, we need to see
who it is, and also see that they’re in

123
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,620
a car.

124
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,330
But how the director decides to use the camera
can also help us understand something about

125
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,880
the character or the themes of the film more
deeply.

126
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,210
Starting in pre-production, the director and
cinematographer work together to design the

127
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,210
shot list.

128
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,710
They’ll usually work with a storyboard artist
to illustrate what the shots will look like

129
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,639
and work off of the storyboards as a reference.

130
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,920
They can do this before the locations are
nailed down, and it’s possible to work on

131
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,760
it even before the actors are cast, because
what determines how a film is shot is that

132
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,020
blueprint we talked about before: the script.

133
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,480
Just like every line of dialogue, every shot
should convey new information to the audience.

134
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,639
We should be able to watch a film with the
sound off and still be able to intuit what’s

135
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,639
going on in the film.

136
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,820
We should be able to know things like who
our protagonist is, what they want, what’s

137
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,630
standing in their way, and how they feel.

138
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:09,490
Once we know what to tell the actors and where
to set the camera, there’s still one huge

139
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:12,270
job for the director left: Post production.

140
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,540
Just like with all the other creative leads,
the director needs to communicate the story

141
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,960
with the editor and composers in order to
tell the best version of the story.

142
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,180
The editing process introduces the final layer
of discovery for the director.

143
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,360
The director is the guiding force in uncovering
the answers right up until the final cut.

144
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,919
What the best version of the story is, depends
on the director and the film.

145
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:34,820
While a director leads their team in unlocking
that best version, they’re also the decision

146
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,820
makers.

147
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,250
They’re holding the whole film in their
heads, and actors, cinematographers, designers,

148
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,680
editors, and composers all give the director
options they think are the right answers for

149
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,789
this film.

150
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:46,770
Then the director chooses which are the best.

151
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:50,110
Depending on the size of the production, the
director might not be the one calling action

152
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:54,199
or cut, but the director is always the one
who says, “Yes, that’s what I want.”

153
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:58,520
Today we explored the director’s role as
a leader and creative guide for everyone else

154
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,860
working on the film.

155
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,860
We learned the director must have a strong
vision and be able to communicate it clearly.

156
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,389
And we talked about how one of the director’s
most important jobs is creating the safe space

157
