00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
Hey there, I'm Mike Rugnetta, this is Crash Course Mythology,

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,300
And today, we are going-

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,320
spelunking!

4
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,280
Spelunking in the world of myth!

5
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,980
Also gardening in the world of myth.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,940
You know what they say:

7
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,460
Dress for the job you want- not the one you have.

8
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,200
Many myths take place outside of time and space,

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,860
remember, "without form and void"?

10
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,560
But often, myths have specific meaningful settings,

11
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,020
and over the next few episodes,

12
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,980
we're going to talk about some of the most important places where myths have happened.

13
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,220
According to scholars Lenard and McClure,

14
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,040
there are many location-based tropes that repeat in myths from around the world.

15
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:39,040
Sacred waters, caves, mountains, and there are mythic gardens, and forests, too.

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,020
Scholar David Leeming has even added cities and temples to the list.

17
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,000
Today we're going to look at two mythic settings side-by-side:

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,720
the garden, and the cave,

19
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,220
which play complementary roles in various stories of creation.

20
00:00:52,240 --> 00:01:01,360
(Theme music)

21
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,700
Considering that gods hate weeding, it's surprising how

22
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,220
many myths involve gardens.

23
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,360
We've discussed a few already, like the Garden of Eden,

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,020
or the Garden of the Hesperides, where the apples of immortality were kept.

25
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,540
Gardens come in different shapes, and sizes,

26
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,980
there are even stories of gardens, inside caves.

27
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,315
You can see this clearly in the Greek and Roman myths of the Underworld.

28
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:24,385
Hades is a vast, underground land.

29
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:28,280
Dark and shadowy, but it still has some lush garden features,

30
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,340
there are pomegranate trees that provide food for Persephone,

31
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,580
and grapes which tempt Tantalus.

32
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:37,820
And yet, when Orpheus attempts to bring Eurydice out of Hades,

33
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:42,000
He's described as bringing her up through the dark mouth of a cave.

34
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,680
Mythic gardens and caves often work as symbols,

35
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,600
more than literal descriptions.

36
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,960
And where the meaning of those symbols need to overlap, they do.

37
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,780
Sometimes in a way that's weird or otherworldly to those of us

38
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,540
with first-hand experience of actual gardens and caves.

39
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,060
But this raises a question:

40
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,860
What symbolic values do we associate with caves and gardens?

41
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,460
To answer, let's turn to a pair of stories about the origin of humanity.

42
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,100
First up, the garden.

43
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,480
We already talked about this story in an earlier episode,

44
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,380
with Adam, and Eve, and a sneaky serpent.

45
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,140
Then, we focused on the actions and relationships of these characters,

46
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,300
and how they set up a social order.

47
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,320
Now, we'll focus on how heavily rooted this story is in place:

48
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:27,820
the idyllic Garden of Eden.

49
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,460
the idyllic Garden of Eden.

50
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,560
We can talk about the garden of Eden,

51
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,060
as both,

52
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:31,555
a physical

53
00:02:31,555 --> 00:02:34,535
setting and a metaphor, as a place

54
00:02:34,535 --> 00:02:37,185
Eden is described as lush and growing.

55
00:02:37,185 --> 00:02:40,045
In addition to Adam and Eve, the place is overrun

56
00:02:40,045 --> 00:02:42,995
with nature and wildlife. Livestock

57
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:45,805
and creeping things and bests of the earth

58
00:02:45,805 --> 00:02:48,085
According to their kinds.  Hey! creeping things, we missed you

59
00:02:48,425 --> 00:02:51,495
we missed you guys. Of all the fruits bearing trees

60
00:02:51,495 --> 00:02:54,345
in the garden, there are two that matter most.

61
00:02:54,345 --> 00:02:56,955
The tree of the knowledge of good and evil and the tree

62
00:02:56,955 --> 00:02:59,925
of eternal life. Entered the sneaky serpent,

63
00:02:59,925 --> 00:03:02,845
and attempt to lied to Yahweh and... you know the rest

64
00:03:02,845 --> 00:03:05,505
but more important than the physical features of Eden, is its position

65
00:03:05,955 --> 00:03:08,745
as a paradise from which humans are expelled

66
00:03:08,935 --> 00:03:12,105
because of their disobedience and as hopeful

67
00:03:12,105 --> 00:03:15,405
state we supposedly want to return to.

68
00:03:15,405 --> 00:03:18,365
Eden doesn't disappear, but humans

69
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,435
never find a way past the angel with the flaming sword

70
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:24,485
who's stationed at and blocking the entrance.

71
00:03:24,485 --> 00:03:27,265
So, the perfect image of the garden,

72
00:03:27,265 --> 00:03:30,355
helps tell the story of humanity's fall from a state of perfection,

73
00:03:30,355 --> 00:03:33,395
to one of debasement. As mythology

74
00:03:33,395 --> 00:03:36,195
scholars Lener and McClure put it, after their disobedience

75
00:03:36,195 --> 00:03:39,305
humans must life "in an ill word,

76
00:03:39,305 --> 00:03:42,255
marked by disharmony, broken relationships

77
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:45,175
suffering and death." We can compare this

78
00:03:45,175 --> 00:03:48,355
story and the symbolism of the garden with a creating myth

79
00:03:48,355 --> 00:03:51,245
from the zuni people of the american west which

80
00:03:51,245 --> 00:03:54,425
involves a very important cave, one inspired

81
00:03:54,425 --> 00:03:57,265
by the grand canyon. According to the Zuni,

82
00:03:57,285 --> 00:04:00,205
humanity wasn't expelled from a bright garden,

83
00:04:00,205 --> 00:04:03,015
but rather emerged from a system of dark

84
00:04:03,215 --> 00:04:06,325
forbidden caves. Instead of paradise,

85
00:04:06,335 --> 00:04:09,325
these caves serves as a symbol for chaos.

86
00:04:09,325 --> 00:04:12,275
Lets go to the thought bubble. Long ago,

87
00:04:12,275 --> 00:04:15,015
before humanity was fully formed, they all lived

88
00:04:15,015 --> 00:04:17,295
deep on the ground, in dark caves.

89
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,815
No one can see could see each other, the humans have horns

90
00:04:20,815 --> 00:04:23,615
and a tails, they have webbed finger and

91
00:04:23,615 --> 00:04:26,615
toes and lack some... other... features

92
00:04:26,615 --> 00:04:29,225
too. You'll see soon enough! The sun, sees

93
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:32,275
humanity living in this state and sends his two

94
00:04:32,275 --> 00:04:35,305
sons, younger brother and elder brother to help

95
00:04:35,305 --> 00:04:38,525
the people travel off to the bright hills of surface.

96
00:04:38,615 --> 00:04:41,605
Elder and younger find the people in,

97
00:04:41,605 --> 00:04:42,605
gross conditions

98
00:04:42,775 --> 00:04:46,045
stepping and spitting and urinating on each other.

99
00:04:46,045 --> 00:04:49,035
So, elder and younger plant trees.

100
00:04:49,035 --> 00:04:52,195
Pines, spruce, silver spruce and aspen.

101
00:04:52,195 --> 00:04:54,935
Each representing one of the cardinal directions.

102
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:58,465
As the brothers rise through the levels of the under realm,

103
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,775
they drive a prayer stick from one of the trees

104
00:05:01,775 --> 00:05:02,775
into the earth.

105
00:05:03,295 --> 00:05:06,205
This creates a sound like thunder,

106
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:09,235
that raises the people into each new world.

107
00:05:09,235 --> 00:05:13,630
The people are now on the surface but they aren't fit for their new home.

108
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,205
Elder and younger,

109
00:05:15,205 --> 00:05:18,225
given them corn, only to realize, the

110
00:05:18,225 --> 00:05:19,225
people have not mouth

111
00:05:19,795 --> 00:05:22,715
so while the people sleep, the two sneak among them

112
00:05:22,715 --> 00:05:25,375
and cut mouths into their heads

113
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,375
so they can eat and luckily, the people love eating.

114
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:31,405
Until... another problem pops up.

115
00:05:31,405 --> 00:05:34,385
All that digested corn has no where to go. Younger

116
00:05:34,385 --> 00:05:37,465
realizes that none of these people have anuses. [fart sound]

117
00:05:37,835 --> 00:05:40,895
So, another round of sleepy top surgery and everyone

118
00:05:40,895 --> 00:05:43,625
fells much...relieved. Over the next days

119
00:05:43,765 --> 00:05:46,135
elder and younger keep tweaking the humans,

120
00:05:46,135 --> 00:05:49,095
slicing their webbed hands so they can cook, chopping off

121
00:05:49,095 --> 00:05:52,535
their horns and tails, until at long last, humans...

122
00:05:52,695 --> 00:05:55,545
are complete. Thanks thought bubble! there are other versions of

123
00:05:55,545 --> 00:05:58,495
the Zuni myth where, after emerging from a spot at the grand

124
00:05:58,495 --> 00:06:01,745
canyon, the Zuni people set off in search of the "idiwan'a"

125
00:06:01,745 --> 00:06:04,765
or "Middle place", where they can achieve

126
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:06,985
balance. On their journey, they stopped

127
00:06:06,985 --> 00:06:10,035
at a number of sites that become sacred to the Zuni, until finally

128
00:06:10,035 --> 00:06:12,615
settling at a spot near the head waters of the

129
00:06:12,615 --> 00:06:15,725
Zuni river. All the sacred places are tied together

130
00:06:15,725 --> 00:06:18,805
by the river of the region. But, we're going to talk about the sacred waters

131
00:06:18,805 --> 00:06:21,925
in a later episode, whats important for now, is the role that

132
00:06:21,925 --> 00:06:24,785
caves play in the symbolism of this

133
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:27,755
creation story. As a place of confusion,

134
00:06:27,765 --> 00:06:30,625
out of which humanity is guided. Before,

135
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:33,705
comparing this cave of creation with the garden of Genesis,

136
00:06:33,705 --> 00:06:36,640
it's interesting to look at another image of the cave that has had

137
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,080
profound influence on the western thinking,

138
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:40,860
and echos

139
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,260
the association of caves, with immaturity

140
00:06:43,265 --> 00:06:46,315
or under development. Plato's

141
00:06:46,315 --> 00:06:49,445
allegory of the cave. In his Republic, Plato describes

142
00:06:49,445 --> 00:06:52,415
a great cave as a way to explain, why people wouldn't

143
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:55,225
readily accept the wisdom of

144
00:06:55,225 --> 00:06:58,035
awesome philosophers? like himself.

145
00:06:58,035 --> 00:07:00,925
It asks us to imagine a world in which humans are sitting in

146
00:07:00,925 --> 00:07:04,075
a dark cage, chained up so they can only face forward.

147
00:07:04,075 --> 00:07:07,245
Behind them, out of view, unseen agents parade

148
00:07:07,245 --> 00:07:10,295
a series of objects, in front of a great light,

149
00:07:10,435 --> 00:07:13,295
from where humanity sits, they can only see

150
00:07:13,295 --> 00:07:16,295
the shadow that flicker across the wall, cast

151
00:07:16,295 --> 00:07:16,920
by the real objects

152
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,240
behind them.

153
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,225
The shadows, are

154
00:07:20,355 --> 00:07:21,505
their reality. Plato says

155
00:07:21,955 --> 00:07:24,755
imagine that one of the chained viewers

156
00:07:24,755 --> 00:07:28,235
breaks free and makes his way out of the cave.

157
00:07:28,235 --> 00:07:31,275
Just like the Zinies, Plato's imaginary escapee is

158
00:07:31,305 --> 00:07:34,215
blinded by the brightness of the world outside the

159
00:07:34,215 --> 00:07:36,995
cave. Eventually, his eyes adjust

160
00:07:37,495 --> 00:07:39,995
and things come into focus but,  he still has difficulties

161
00:07:39,995 --> 00:07:43,265
believing that what he sees, is real but

162
00:07:43,265 --> 00:07:46,165
knowing about whats outside the cave, he runs back in

163
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:49,145
to tell the others. When he tries to explain to them that what they

164
00:07:49,145 --> 00:07:52,405
think is really is only a projection,

165
00:07:52,435 --> 00:07:55,405
people in the cave don't believe him. Plato

166
00:07:55,405 --> 00:07:58,285
suggests that those chained up might even try to kill,

167
00:07:58,285 --> 00:08:01,195
who ever got free. That person, who escape

168
00:08:01,195 --> 00:08:04,555
the cave is, you guest it a philosopher.

169
00:08:04,575 --> 00:08:07,265
Point out to the rest of us that our reality

170
00:08:07,265 --> 00:08:10,235
its actually a pale reflection of a more

171
00:08:10,235 --> 00:08:13,095
true world. Plato's cave and the Zuni

172
00:08:13,095 --> 00:08:16,075
emergence story are obviously very different but

173
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:19,095
we want to involve the creation of the anus, for instance. But in both

174
00:08:19,095 --> 00:08:22,075
cases, the world of the cave is both physically

175
00:08:22,075 --> 00:08:24,805
and metaphorically dark, The cave is a

176
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:28,035
position of ignorance or inability and the surface

177
00:08:28,035 --> 00:08:30,935
represents represents enlightenment figuratively and

178
00:08:30,935 --> 00:08:33,985
literately. One can even say that, the emergence

179
00:08:33,985 --> 00:08:36,985
leads to humanity reaching a more perfect state.

180
00:08:36,985 --> 00:08:39,615
As Lener and McClure put it: "In the Zuni tale...

181
00:08:39,615 --> 00:08:42,785
humans existed in a dark, imperfect world...

182
00:08:43,025 --> 00:08:46,045
At the calling of father , they emerged from this

183
00:08:46,045 --> 00:08:48,715
dark chaos into a world of light and

184
00:08:48,715 --> 00:08:51,240
healthy relationships and harmony with

185
00:08:51,705 --> 00:08:54,025
their fellow inhabitants...." This is a stark

186
00:08:54,345 --> 00:08:57,295
contrast to the creation story of Genesis,

187
00:08:57,295 --> 00:09:00,065
where human beings, having being created by God,

188
00:09:00,065 --> 00:09:03,205
begin as perfect beings and then are

189
00:09:03,205 --> 00:09:06,285
forced into a state of imperfection, when

190
00:09:06,285 --> 00:09:09,115
ejected from the garden, like the heaveness revelers they are.

191
00:09:09,545 --> 00:09:12,515
The story of humanity, isn't only a story of a

192
00:09:12,515 --> 00:09:15,575
fall but a quest to return, to

193
00:09:15,575 --> 00:09:18,735
reenter paradise. Obviously, in the Zinies story,

194
00:09:18,735 --> 00:09:21,465
none is clamoring to get back into the cave of

195
00:09:21,465 --> 00:09:24,475
no anus. We can ask then, whether this

196
00:09:24,475 --> 00:09:27,765
inverted orientations regarding creation make a difference

197
00:09:27,765 --> 00:09:30,525
in their respect to cultures. Do you go

198
00:09:30,525 --> 00:09:33,515
about your day differently, depending upon whether you think of earth

199
00:09:33,515 --> 00:09:36,385
as a place of punishment for leaving

200
00:09:36,385 --> 00:09:37,915
a perfect garden versus

201
00:09:38,785 --> 00:09:41,845
the garden itself? A reward

202
00:09:41,845 --> 00:09:44,855
for making it out of the dark cave of chaos. Next week,

203
00:09:44,855 --> 00:09:48,035
we are going to stick with our mythical settings and head for the hills

204
00:09:48,035 --> 00:09:51,195
to talk about, magical mountains. Thank for watching,

205
00:09:51,195 --> 00:09:52,195
