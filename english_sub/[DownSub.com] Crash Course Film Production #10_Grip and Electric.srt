1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,930
Have you ever tried to take a picture of a
sunset?

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:05,980
How’d it turn out?

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,310
It probably looked pretty bad compared to
the real thing, right?

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,030
Now, have you ever taken a picture of your
friend, when she was lit by the sunset?

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,070
It probably looked amazing!

6
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,599
The sun can be so fickle.

7
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:16,209
But we need it for...life.

8
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:19,610
Luckily we don’t need it for filmmaking anymore.

9
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,449
We can recreate a sunset and make it last
for hours.

10
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:26,460
We can light a lightning storm or make a room
look like it’s lit with just a few candles,

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,570
but still be able to actually see.

12
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,418
Light can accentuate drama or playup humor
or build suspense.

13
00:00:32,418 --> 00:00:35,310
And, without it, the camera literally captures
nothing.

14
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,650
Without light, film is...radio.

15
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:41,430
And the production departments that control
all the light are usually grouped together

16
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,379
as G&E: Grip & Electric.

17
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:47,220
We’ve talked about the designers who build
the mise-en-scene through sets, costumes,

18
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,960
hair and makeup, but the lighting design is
just as important.

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,550
A blank wall can be transformed with light
and shadow.

20
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,090
I mean, you know this –– an instagram
can be made into art by controlling light

21
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,090
and shadow.

22
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,860
This is part of the reason Grip & Electric
work so well together.

23
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,920
The electricians bring in and control the
light, while the grips control the shadow.

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:16,480
[Intro Music Plays]

25
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,480
Both the grip and electric teams work together
as an arm of the camera team.

26
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,260
The Gaffer, Best Boy Electric, and electricians
work with the cinematographer to design the lighing.

27
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,940
And the Key Grip, Best Boy Grip, and grips
work with all the non-electrical equipment

28
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,250
for the lighting and camera departments.

29
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:35,950
The Electrical Lighting Technicians, or ELTs,
are responsible for getting light, but also

30
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:36,950
power, to the set.

31
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:41,080
Like almost every crew position, it’s a
mix of creativity and technical skill.

32
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,750
When it comes to lighting, though, it’s
especially technical.

33
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,930
Like, there’s math.

34
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:49,240
The Electric department has to make a new
plan for every lighting set up and every location.

35
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,250
This plan is informed by the look the director
and cinematographer want to achieve, but also

36
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,880
by the power that’s available on site or
from the generators they’re able to bring

37
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,280
So the electric team isn’t just lighting
a set.

38
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,090
They’re also bringing power to it.

39
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,540
A lot of power, that could be deadly if it’s
not handled safely.

40
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,010
But who’s responsible for safety on set?

41
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,229
That’s easy.

42
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,229
You are.

43
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,350
There are too many moving parts and changing
orders on a film set for safety to not be

44
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,910
everyone’s priority.

45
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:18,600
So, trust me when I say, if an electrician
tells you to do something on set, do it.

46
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,030
It’s for your safety.

47
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:24,980
The gaffer and the electric team have to understand
the capacity of their equipment and the power

48
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,480
supplies that they’re pulling from.

49
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,140
They also need to stay up to date on technology
changes.

50
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,410
LED lights, for example, are just starting
to be used on sets.

51
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:36,070
But of course, the whole purpose of the electric
department’s technical skill is to put it

52
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,200
to use creatively and convincingly.

53
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,940
It can be easy to think of light as just light,
but think of the light in an old church or

54
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,640
the light in a big box store.

55
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,720
Different, right?

56
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,680
Think of a cold rainy beach or a sunny mountain
top.

57
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,260
It’s the same sun but it looks so different.

58
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,480
Grip and electric teams work to control light,
and one of the most important tools at their

59
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,980
disposal is understanding color temperature.

60
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,910
Think again about that old church versus that
rainy beach: they’re about the same brightness,

61
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,080
but they’re different colors.

62
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,430
The light in the church is what we’d call
“warm”; it’s kind of orange.

63
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,910
Whereas the light on the beach is “cool”;
looks more blue.

64
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:13,220
That’s because the light has different color
temperatures, which we measure in Kelvin, or K.

65
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:18,340
Typically, outdoor lighting is around 5600K,
or what we call “daylight balanced,” because

66
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,480
the sun’s light is 5600K.

67
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,590
Indoor lighting is 3200K, or “tungsten,”
because tungsten is what the filaments in

68
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,990
lightbulbs are made from, and it puts out
light at 3200K.

69
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:32,700
Obviously, there’s a whole lot of wiggle
room between those, and the camera needs to

70
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,970
be set up to match the color temperature of
the lights.

71
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,440
When you see a video that looks really orange,
it’s because the lights are tungsten but

72
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,340
the camera is set to daylight balance.

73
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,350
And vice versa when the video looks really
blue.

74
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:46,000
You can get bulbs that are either daylight
balanced or tungsten, but if you only have

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,610
one type of bulb to light your film inside
and out, you can change their color temperature

76
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,410
pretty affordably with gels.

77
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,440
Gels are transparent color filters.

78
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,709
They come in many colors, but they’re most
commonly used in blue or orange.

79
00:03:56,709 --> 00:03:59,940
And they come in different densities, too,
depending on how much light you're working with.

80
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:04,680
Once the color temperature is right for the
scene, G&E still has to control how the light moves.

81
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,180
We talked about the basic 3-point lighting
set up when we talked about cinematography.

82
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:13,240
The key light, the fill light, and the back
light, or hair light, all work together to

83
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,399
give a scene depth and allow the audience
to feel like they’re looking at a real space,

84
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,399
not a screen.

85
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,588
But you don’t just put up three lights in
a triangle.

86
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:25,080
The electricians and grips shape the light
to create the look the gaffer and cinematographer want.

87
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,080
Under the direction of the gaffer, the electricians
use the lights themselves to do this, and

88
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,159
the grips use several tools to block and steer
the light.

89
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:34,379
Because, remember that fickle sun?

90
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:37,110
Light will go wherever you let it, but it
needs to be guided.

91
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,530
The first way to do this is with different
lights.

92
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:43,620
The key, fill, and hair lights usually descend
in order of intensity.

93
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,719
The key will put out the most light, then
the fill, then the hair light.

94
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,530
But, not all light sources are lights.

95
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:52,440
Frequently, the fill light is just light from
the key light bouncing off of a white wall,

96
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,300
a mirror, or, appropriately enough, a bounce
board.

97
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,120
A skilled grip can aim light with a bounce
board, but beyond that, there are many more

98
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,270
ways to control the light.

99
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,879
The lights themselves have barn doors that
control how much light comes through and how

100
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:04,999
it’s aimed.

101
00:05:04,999 --> 00:05:08,800
Barn doors are also where you can clip your
gels, if you need them, with your trusty c-47s.

102
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,319
G&E equipment gets the best names.

103
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:15,900
A lot of the effort in lighting is spent trying
to avoid unwanted shadows, but sometimes you

104
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,979
need shadows to shape the light how you want
it.

105
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:20,639
And the grips have all the rigging and equipment
to do that.

106
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,270
Some of the most versatile pieces of equipment
that grips use are flags mounted on to c-stands,

107
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,750
to block, or “cut” the light.

108
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,979
They’ll block light for the camera, but
because the grip department oversees pretty

109
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:33,750
much all the non-electrical equipment for
the set, they’ll also block light for things

110
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,800
like video village.

111
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,900
And no, that’s not the last of the DVD-rental
chains -- it’s where people who can’t

112
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,099
see the camera can watch video playback of
what the camera is capturing.

113
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:46,080
For this, the team will usually use a special
kind of flag, called a floppy, because it

114
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,930
has a floppy drape that can be opened to block
out more light.

115
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,710
Flags are sometimes called cutters, too, because
they break up the light sharply.

116
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:56,280
But when the shadow needs to be more subtle,
G&E will use diffusion.

117
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,439
If the electricians want to lessen the intensity
of a light, they can add diffusion to it,

118
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:02,419
much like how they add gels.

119
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:06,080
On some lights they can add screens called
scrims over the lens of the light.

120
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,280
Grips can also bring in flags called silks
to put in front of large lights to diffuse them.

121
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,860
And really big silks are used to protect an
entire set from the sun for an outdoor scene.

122
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,979
Indoors, grips can control the light in a
scene by using black wrap, or cinefoil, to

123
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:21,319
direct light or seal the windows from sunlight.

124
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:25,349
Now, not only do grips have the power to block
out the sun and build the rigging for light

125
00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:28,729
and shadow, they also build and manage the
equipment for the camera department.

126
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:33,300
In fact, the ways in which the camera moves are almost all built and maintained by the grips.

127
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,180
If it’s a locked down shot, the grips set
up the tripod.

128
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,409
If it’s a dolly shot, grips lay the dolly
track and control the dolly movements.

129
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:44,569
If the shot calls for a jib or a crane, grips
build and control this movement as well.

130
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:49,340
Even handheld shots often rely on grips, because
the camera operator may need to be on a ladder,

131
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,669
which will be held by a grip, or they may
put the camera on an apple box between shots,

132
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:55,139
which would be provided by the grip department.

133
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:59,660
And, I can’t mention this enough, just like
the electricians have be manage safety of

134
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:04,009
the electricity and cables and bulbs they’re
using, grips are always thinking about safety

135
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:05,009
with equipment.

136
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:09,330
From the way a c-stand is positioned to the
way a screw is tightened, there is a protocol

137
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:13,419
and a language for everything the grips are
doing to keep everyone on set safe.

138
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:18,110
Two of the most common words you’ll hear
from G&E are “striking” and “points.”

139
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:21,199
Striking is called when an electrician is
turning on a light.

140
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,879
It’s a courtesy for anyone on set to look
away from the bright light, but it’s also

141
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,560
a warning that something potentially dangerous
is about to happen.

142
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,860
A fuse might blow, a bulb might break, and
by calling “striking” the crew is getting

143
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,860
a head’s up.

144
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,619
Points means someone is carrying something
big and pointy.

145
00:07:35,619 --> 00:07:36,659
Probably a c-stand.

146
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:38,800
So be aware and watch where you’re moving.

147
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,779
Knowing these two words will help keep you
safe, and also keep you from being obnoxious

148
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:44,069
on a film set.

149
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:45,069
All good things!

150
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:48,589
Today we learned about the electric team and
how it balances the technical and the creative

151
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:49,919
sides of lighting.

152
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,619
We looked at some of the equipment electricians
use to shape light and talked about safety

153
00:07:53,619 --> 00:07:56,309
and language associated with the electric
department.

154
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,699
We also talked about the responsibilities
of the grip department and how they support

155
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:03,729
the electric department, the camera department,
and all the non-electric equipment being used

156
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:04,979
by various departments on set.

157
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:09,379
Next time, we’ll get into even more movie
magic with special effects, both on camera

158
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:10,520
and in post production.
