1
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,170
Sometimes it’s impractical -- or physically
impossible -- to get the shot you want.

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,950
Maybe the scene takes place on an imaginary
planet.

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,820
Maybe the film is about a magical creature.

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,370
Maybe the story requires action that would
be too dangerous to film in real life.

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,529
That’s when filmmakers turn to special effects
and special effects makeup.

6
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:22,880
If film is an illusion, special effects are
simply one more way to achieve or enhance

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,880
that illusion.

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,539
Whether it’s making Superman fly,
allowing Fred Astaire to dance on the ceiling,

9
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,529
or engineering a fight between Leonardo DiCaprio
and one angry bear,

10
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:35,470
vast teams of artists and craftspeople have
devoted their working lives to making the

11
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,650
impossible possible.

12
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,560
Let’s feast our eyes on the world of special
effects.

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:52,240
[Intro Music Plays]

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,840
We think of special effects as a recent development,

15
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,280
but it’s actually been around in some form
since the earliest days of cinema.

16
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,379
Beginning with the trick films of Georges
Méliès, filmmakers have been using things

17
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:06,240
like double exposure, matte painting, tinting,
and creative cuts to create magic on screen.

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,340
And they’re still at it!

19
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,829
James Cameron can take us to the bottom of
the sea – twice! – in The Abyss and Titanic.

20
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:16,560
Ridley Scott can immerse us in the neon-drenched
futuristic LA of Blade Runner.

21
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,450
Films like Zodiac and Far from the Madding
Crowd can use special effects to transport

22
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,450
us into the past.

23
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,219
And James Gunn can launch us into space with
a quip and a ship full of misfits in Guardians

24
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:27,219
of the Galaxy.

25
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:30,079
But special effects can also be used in much
more subtle ways.

26
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,409
Rather than draw attention to themselves,
these effects are meant to go undetected by

27
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:35,409
the audience.

28
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:38,990
Citizen Kane, for instance, is not much less
fabricated than the original Star Wars.

29
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:42,810
In fact, Orson Welles’ classic film was
a pioneer in visual effects,

30
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,759
optically printing massive exterior shots, and featuring sophisticated

31
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:51,869
old age makeup – complete with cinema’s
first use of contact lenses to give characters

32
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:52,869
cataracts.

33
00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:56,929
More recently, dramas like 2010’s The Social
Network used computer-generated imagery, or

34
00:01:56,929 --> 00:02:02,280
CGI, to complete city skylines and allow one
actor, Armie Hammer, to portray twins.

35
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,700
In Stephen Soderbergh’s Oscar-winning 2001
film Traffic, CGI was even used to create

36
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,050
tears on a character’s face to enhance their
emotion.

37
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,560
In fact, the vast majority of mainstream Hollywood
movies of the 21st century include at least

38
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,780
one shot that has been altered by special
effects technology.

39
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,739
Special effects can be broken down into several
main types, which can be used on their own,

40
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:24,330
or combined to produce an image that meets
the needs of the film.

41
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,350
Mechanical or Practical Effects are special
effects created on set.

42
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:32,290
These include physical character creation,
puppetry, animatronics, and more.

43
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,260
Think of the Cantina scene in the original
Star Wars film, before Lucas went in and

44
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:40,230
used computers to tinker with everything and
NO I’M STILL NOT OVER IT!

45
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,630
All those creatures were either puppets, animatronics,
or human actors wearing prosthetic makeup

46
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,730
or costumes.

47
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:50,550
Pyrotechnics, like fires or explosions, also
fall under practical effects, along with wind,

48
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,190
rain, mist, snow, and smoke.

49
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:55,650
In some cases, even running water constitutes
a practical effect.

50
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,489
Unless the film is being shot in an actual
location, someone has to plumb the set if

51
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:01,550
you want water to run from the faucet.

52
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:06,299
Optical Effects are created in the camera
as the film is being shot using optical instruments.

53
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:10,780
A lot of these techniques require extra equipment,
skills, and time, and nearly all of these

54
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,609
effects are now easier and faster to create
using computers.

55
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:18,629
Optical printing involves a combination of
the camera, a projector, and a special printer.

56
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:23,190
You begin by filming a live action scene,
matting out the section you want to replace.

57
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,879
This is called the “garbage matte.”

58
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,450
Then you film a shot that you’d like to
use in place of the matted section.

59
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,670
This is called a “plate”.

60
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,640
Finally, you combine the two pieces of film
in an optical printer, and, voilà: special effect!!!

61
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,160
Compositing is a technique now commonly called
“blue screen” or “green screen.”

62
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,510
Originally, black screens were used.

63
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,760
Actors would be filmed performing in front
of the screen, and then the black screen would

64
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,670
be replaced by a separately filmed background.

65
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:50,200
The problem was, dark shadows also appeared
black.

66
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,659
So any shadow on the actor’s clothing or
face would also be replaced by the background.

67
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:55,659
Not a good look.

68
00:03:55,659 --> 00:04:00,400
Color cinematography and beam-splitting cameras
allowed filmmakers to expose selective colors

69
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,029
on two or three different negatives.

70
00:04:02,029 --> 00:04:05,930
Suddenly, it was possible to use a specific
color for the screen, one that would be much

71
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,519
easier to separate from the actors or their
costumes.

72
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,030
The first major use blue screens in a feature
film was the 1940 Technicolor spectacle The

73
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:17,450
Thief of Bagdad, which won Oscars for both
Cinematography and Special Effects.

74
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:21,269
This technique continued to be refined until
blue screens were the norm into the 1970s

75
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,269
and ‘80s.

76
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:26,210
Green screens have become more common since
the advent of digital cinematography, because

77
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:30,600
green is less present in human skin and hair, and digital cameras are more sensitive to it.

78
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,560
Filmmakers use both blue and green today,
depending on the cameras being used and the

79
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,389
costumes worn by the characters.

80
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:40,110
For instance, you might not want to shoot
Superman in front of a blue screen, because

81
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,101
it could make him look like nothing but a
floating head, hands, boots, undies, a big

82
00:04:44,101 --> 00:04:45,690
red “S” and a cape.

83
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,500
Again, not a good look.

84
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,520
Optical effects can also include scale models,
miniatures, and forced perspective props and sets.

85
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,760
These techniques allowed Peter Jackson to
turn full-sized human beings into hobbits

86
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,699
and then have them interact with human characters
on the same set.

87
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:04,360
Rotoscoping is an optical effect that involves
hand-tracing the subject of a shot, frame

88
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,030
by frame, so that it can be animated or more
meticulously matted into another shot.

89
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:13,720
Stop motion, sometimes called Claymation,
involves shooting a model one still frame

90
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,110
at a time, moving it slightly between each
shot.

91
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,750
The Imperial Walkers in The Empire Strikes
Back were created using this technique,

92
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,819
as well as animated films from Wallace and
Gromit

93
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:23,500
to The Fantastic Mr. Fox.

94
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,639
Beginning in the 1970s, another weapon was
added to the special effects arsenal: computer-generated

95
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,180
imagery or “CGI.”

96
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,930
CGI covers everything from two-dimensional
animation to the fully realized 3D world of

97
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,020
something like Avatar.

98
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:40,060
Basic rule of thumb is: if the effect is made
on a computer, it’s some sort of CGI.

99
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,780
The first mainstream feature film to use CGI
was the original Westworld, directed by Michael

100
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,900
Crichton in 1973,
and its sequel Futureworld in 1976.

101
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,479
The effects themselves were quite simple – a
robot’s vision of our world, a 3D rendering

102
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:58,110
of a spinning hand – but they actually represented
an enormous step forward in the art and craft

103
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,319
of special effects.

104
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,750
Nine years later, the very first photorealistic
CGI character appeared, in the film Young

105
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,729
Sherlock Holmes, in which a stained glass
window shatters and the shards come back together

106
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:09,979
to form an animated, sword-wielding knight.

107
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:14,349
This moment paved the way for major advances
in CGI character creation…,

108
00:06:14,349 --> 00:06:18,360
from fantasy creatures like Gollum or
Groot, to recognizably human figures like

109
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,560
Benjamin Button or
the young Princess Leia at the end of Rogue One.

110
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,069
Other aspects of CGI were equally revolutionary.

111
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:29,570
Digital compositing made combining various
images and image fields much quicker and easier.

112
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:34,360
Keyframing, meanwhile, lets animators draw
a character or object once, and then set points

113
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,000
– or “keyframes” – to indicate how
the image should move over a given amount

114
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,120
of time.

115
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,470
This saves artists from having to draw each
frame of an image separately.

116
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:46,819
Now, what if your canvas as a special effects
artist is actually a person?

117
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:50,330
Artists who specialize in special effects
makeup are trained in the same skills as

118
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:55,160
traditional hair and makeup artists, and then
develop more specialized expertise in creating

119
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,629
things like injuries, old age, deformities,
and the creation of monsters, aliens, and

120
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:00,629
other creatures.

121
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:04,319
One of the first filmmakers to excel at this
kind of special effects makeup was the actor

122
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,979
Lon Chaney, Sr. Nicknamed “The Man of a
Thousand Faces” for his ability to transform

123
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:12,310
into other characters,
he developed his own makeup techniques to

124
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:17,000
star in Silent Era horror classics like
1923’s The Hunchback of Notre Dame and

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,400
Rupert Julian’s adaptation of The Phantom
of the Opera.

126
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,520
In the early days, major film studios had
their own “in house” effects teams.

127
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,380
Then during the 1960s and 70s, the studios
scaled back, and those teams set up their

128
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,570
own special effects houses which were then
hired by the studios for specific projects.

129
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:35,669
Today some of the most famous brand-names
in the business include Industrial Light and

130
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:38,220
Magic, founded by George Lucas in 1975;

131
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,620
Digital Domain, created in 1993 by filmmaker
James Cameron, along with master creature

132
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,720
creator Stan Winston and digital effects guru
Scott Ross;

133
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,189
and Peter Jackson’s WETA Digital, which
has created the effects-heavy drama Heavenly

134
00:07:50,189 --> 00:07:53,650
Creatures, most of the Lord of the Rings saga,
and Avatar, among others.

135
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:57,569
Now, whether it’s in-house or not, the special
effects team is most often overseen by a visual

136
00:07:57,569 --> 00:07:58,569
effects supervisor.

137
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:02,370
Their job is to ensure that the effects fit
the vision of the director and the needs of

138
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:05,910
the film, and that the effects are completed
on time and on budget.

139
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:10,669
In order to accomplish this, they assemble
and work with a variety of special effects

140
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:15,840
artists, from digital matte painters and compositors,
to roto artists who specialize in rotoscoping,

141
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,820
and lighting technical directors who work
as gaffers in the digital space, making sure

142
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,190
the direction, color, intensity, and mood
of the lighting matches the rest of the film.

143
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:28,629
Pre-vis – or pre-visualization – artists
help filmmakers anticipate what an effect

144
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:33,299
will look like when the film is complete,
and concept artists use illustrations to help

145
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:36,289
filmmakers design effects, creatures, and
environments.

146
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:41,529
Other artists specialize in rendering, animation,
weather design, enhancing explosions, combining

147
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:44,280
all the elements into a finished effect, and
on and on.

148
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:48,580
Special effects is an ever-expanding field,
as new technologies emerge to make innovative

149
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,230
effects possible.

150
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:54,260
If you’ve ever watched the credits on an
effects-heavy film, you know they list hundreds

151
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,830
of names under special effects.

152
00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:00,130
All those artists spend their days working
to make the impossible possible, to wow us

153
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:03,890
with their imagery, and to enhance the illusion
of reality that is a film.

154
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,330
Today we talked about the earliest days of
special effects, from the silent trick films

155
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:11,290
of Georges Méliès to the subtle work in
Citizen Kane.

156
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:15,230
We broke down some of the the techniques used
to create special effects before computers

157
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,270
