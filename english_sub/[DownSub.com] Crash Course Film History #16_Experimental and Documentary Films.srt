00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,740
Hello, my name is Craig and this is Crash Course Film History.

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,680
Most movies that we watch are examples of
narrative filmmaking.

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,200
They’re works of fiction, and tell made-up
stories about invented characters.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,779
Even films that are based on actual events
are carefully crafted stories that are made

5
00:00:16,779 --> 00:00:18,410
to seem real or plausible.

6
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:23,670
But there are types of cinema that play by
entirely different rules... weird rules.

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,250
Experimental films reject the techniques and
goals of narrative filmmaking altogether,

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,910
aiming to evoke a specific mood, thought,
or emotion.

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,371
And documentary films may borrow from the
narrative techniques of fiction films, but

10
00:00:33,371 --> 00:00:36,700
instead of inventing their stories and characters,
they seek them out in the real world.

11
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,109
These filmmaking styles both have their own
histories, methods, and major figures.

12
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:43,680
And they interact with the fictional narrative
movies we’re used to watching in interesting ways.

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,000
It’s time to jump into Experimental and Documentary films.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:59,760
[Opening Music Plays]

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,469
We could easily spend an entire Crash Course

16
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:04,150
series on the history of either experimental
or documentary film.

17
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,990
There’s a long tradition of filmmakers using
cinema to achieve different goals than mainstream

18
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:12,180
narrative films, which are usually trying
to educate or entertain by telling a story.

19
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,720
Experimental film covers all kinds of movies,
from shorts and features, to films with vague

20
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,120
storylines and those that reject narrative
altogether.

21
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,480
No story, no setting, and no characters.

22
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,360
You’ll sometimes see experimental film referred
to as “avant-garde” or “vangarde” cinema.

23
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,160
Or, "That Weird Stuff."

24
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,250
Whatever you call it, it wasn’t until the
strict conventions of narrative fiction filmmaking

25
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,160
took hold in the early 20th century that experimental
cinema came into its own.

26
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,810
Because it deliberately opposes those conventions.

27
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,890
Audiences used to mainstream action movies
and rom-coms might feel confused or even frustrated

28
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,750
by non-narrative experimental cinema.

29
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,910
Some experimental films are trying to make
you feel uncomfortable, test your patience,

30
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,690
or push you to think more deeply.

31
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,720
Others might be profoundly beautiful abstractions,
intended to soothe you.

32
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,720
I like to think that I'm a profoundly beautiful abstraction intended to soothe you.

33
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,440
The thing that binds all these films together

34
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,560
is that they refuse to be bound by the typical
rules of telling a story.

35
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,940
The first major avant-garde movements in the
arts began to flourish in Europe in the 1920s,

36
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,280
just as narrative feature films were asserting
themselves

37
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,040
as the dominant commercial form of cinema.

38
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,750
At this time, a group of French filmmakers
inaugurated the Cinèma pur movement.

39
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:14,960
Their goal was to return film to its most
basic elements, which they saw as light and motion.

40
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,950
Filmmakers like René Clair, Fernand Léger, Man Ray, and Marcel Duchamp emerged

41
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,300
from the Dada art movement.

42
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,530
They viewed the rules of narrative storytelling
as tyrannical and bourgeois.

43
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,939
So instead of building their films around
characters involved in a plot, they focused

44
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:31,139
on images, trick shots, slow or fast motion,
and eventually music and sound.

45
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:35,390
René Clair’s 1924 film Entr'acte is 22
minutes long and comprised of disconnected

46
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:39,319
shots like people running in slow motion,
a cannon being fired, a ballet dancer shot

47
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:41,260
from below, and people disappearing.

48
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,120
The rhythm is beautiful, but there’s no
story in sight.

49
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,400
I think I had a dream like that once.

50
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,720
That same year, Fernand Lèger made the frenetic
short film Ballet Mécanique with co-director

51
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:50,739
Dudley Murphy.

52
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:54,859
Constructed of abstract images, either painted
or drawn, upside down shots, mechanical devices,

53
00:02:54,859 --> 00:02:59,160
double-exposures, and more, the film explores
the relationship between art, design, and engineering.

54
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,920
Surrealism, another abstract art movement,
took a more whimsical and sometimes confrontational approach.

55
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,120
The Surrealists drew on dream-like imagery
that invites interpretation, but isn’t directly symbolic.

56
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,920
Their work aims to not have any literal meaning,
but still be moving, scary, beautiful, or absurd.

57
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,840
I like to think of myself as moving, scary, beautiful, or absurd.

58
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,069
Salvador Dali is probably the most famous
surrealist, and collaborated on a funny, disturbing

59
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:22,099
film with director Louis Buñuel.

60
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:26,469
Released in 1929, Un Chien Andalou is made
up of a series of scenes that seem to be about

61
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:28,550
a volatile relationship between a man and
a woman.

62
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,560
The film doesn’t make logical sense, and
yet it provokes a strong sense of wonder and dread.

63
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,440
Once you see it, you’ll never forget it.

64
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,840
I saw it, I remember.

65
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,239
Now, the 1940s saw the arrival of American
filmmaker Maya Deren who believed that film

66
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,980
was meant to create an experience, not tell
a story.

67
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:47,290
Her films Meshes of the Afternoon and Meditation
on Violence lull viewers into expecting a

68
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:51,319
story with some narrative film techniques,
only to move into abstract shots and cuts

69
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:53,980
that make it impossible to understand what
the heck is going on.

70
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,010
That’s because the point isn’t to understand the film, but rather to feel it.

71
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,819
And it just goes to show: without a steady
diet of mainstream narrative films, much of

72
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:04,200
the avant-garde wouldn’t work – we wouldn’t
have the expectations that Deren’s films subvert.

73
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,600
Hey Nick, can we do an experimental film where I repeatedly punch the eagle over and over again?

74
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,480
Nick: No.

75
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,430
Working from the 1950s to the 1980s, Stan
Brakhage is an acknowledged master of experimental

76
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,810
film and known for a kind of cinematic collage.

77
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:24,090
He found unusual techniques to create abstract
imagery, from physically painting or scratching

78
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,160
the film, to using multiple exposures and
rapid movement to mimic the

79
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,840
movement of the human eye.

80
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,520
And Canadian filmmaker Guy Maddin is perhaps the most widely known living experimental filmmaker.

81
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,360
Working in short films, features, and installation
art, Maddin refuses to be identified with

82
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,900
any particular style or theme.

83
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,720
In his hands, true experimental film continues
to thrive.

84
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,730
Many narrative filmmakers have drawn inspiration
from experimental film.

85
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:47,450
Before he made Luke, Han, and Vader, George
Lucas made his own politically charged avant-garde

86
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,250
shorts as a film student at USC.

87
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,460
David Lynch, the mind behind Blue Velvet and
Twin Peaks, borrows heavily from the experimental

88
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,460
film tradition.

89
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,820
Although his films are clearly telling stories,
they don’t seem interested in answering

90
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,820
their own questions.

91
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,880
They’re often about ambiguity, dream logic,
and the fine line between absurdity and violence.

92
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,430
Other narrative feature films skirt the edge
of experimental cinema – from E. Elias Merhige’s

93
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,500
horror movie Begotten and David Gordon Green’s
coming-of-age drama George Washington, to

94
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,540
Steven Soderbergh’s The Girlfriend Experience.

95
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,540
Just to name a few.

96
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,120
Now, you may not have seen many experimental
films, but chances are you’ve seen a few documentaries.

97
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,840
Documentary film is almost as broad a category
as experimental film.

98
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,250
Some documentaries rely on interviews, while
others use footage of actual events.

99
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,870
Some take a more abstract approach, and others
use narrative fiction techniques to recreate

100
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:26,870
past events.

101
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,000
Whatever its methods, a documentary is a work of non-fiction that aims to explore – or document –

102
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,760
some aspect of reality as accurately
as possible.

103
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,640
But it’s important to remember it’s still
a film told through the lens of a filmmaker,

104
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,300
and still an illusion of reality.

105
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,800
The very first films ever made were documentaries,
from Thomas Edison’s vaudeville acts to

106
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,550
the Lumière brothers’ slice-of-life shorts
and actualités.

107
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,150
And the first feature-length film known to
incorporate documentary techniques is Robert

108
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,620
Flaherty’s 1922 film Nanook of the North.

109
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,750
An exploration of the Arctic life of an Inuk
and his family, the film mixed fictional drama

110
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,560
with documentary footage long before that
was a popular – or even accepted – thing to do.

111
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,990
In fact, we didn’t even have the word “documentary”
until 1929, when Scottish filmmaker John Grierson

112
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,710
coined it to describe a work of non-fiction
filmmaking.

113
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,860
In 1932, Grierson wrote an essay called “First
Principles of Documentary” which argued

114
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,880
that the true power of cinema was in recording
and presenting real life,

115
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,640
rather than creating fictional stories.

116
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:18,710
And in the 1930s and ‘40s, documentary film
became a major force in news and propaganda.

117
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:22,720
Prior to television, newsreels often screened
before feature films, presenting documentary

118
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,250
footage of events from around the world.

119
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,460
Governments harnessed the power of documentary
film to sway public opinion.

120
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:31,810
One of the most famous examples is Leni Riefenstahl’s
1935 film Triumph of the Will.

121
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:36,030
Commissioned by Adolf Hitler, the film documented
the Nazi Party Congress in Nuremburg, Germany

122
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:40,580
in 1934, using actual footage, staged scenes,
and stirring music to convey a sense of power

123
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,750
and myth to the Third Reich.

124
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:45,500
The United States set about producing their
own documentaries in response,

125
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,660
like Frank Capra’s “Why We Fight” series, whichdrummed up support for the American war effort

126
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,660
in World War II.

127
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:54,330
In the post-war period from the 1950s to the
1970s, Cinema Verité came into fashion.

128
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,880
Rather than staging action like a narrative
film or employing a narrator to explain what

129
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,580
the audience was seeing, Cinema Verité put
you directly in the center of the action as

130
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,580
it unfolded.

131
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,460
Direct Cinema also emerged in these years.

132
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,240
Very similar to Cinema Verité, these deeply
personal films attempt to present reality

133
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,110
with as little commentary as possible, and
to consider the complex relationship between

134
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,380
cinema and truth.

135
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:17,070
Ross McElwee’s 1985 film Sherman’s March
is a great example.

136
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,120
What begins as a journey along the route of
General Sherman’s Army at the end of the

137
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,700
Civil War, becomes an examination of McElwee’s
inability to find a new romantic partner after

138
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,700
a bad break-up.

139
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,660
The availability of lighter, cheaper, easy-to-use
film equipment made these kinds of films possible,

140
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:33,250
just as they had for Italian Neo-Realism,
French New Wave, and the subsequent generations

141
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,720
of independent fiction filmmakers.

142
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,930
In the 1980s and ‘90s, documentaries flourished
on television, from nature documentaries on

143
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:43,370
the Discovery Channel to long form documentaries
like Ken Burns’ brilliant and comprehensive

144
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,610
9-part film Civil War.

145
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:48,090
These days, platforms like YouTube and Vimeo,
along with high-quality digital cameras and

146
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:52,120
editing software, make it possible to produce
and distribute documentaries extremely quickly.

147
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,030
Now, like experimental film, the documentary
tradition has influenced fiction films and

148
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,340
been influenced in return.

149
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:01,000
Mockumentaries use the visual and narrative
techniques of a documentary to tell a fictional story.

150
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,720
Usually to hilarious results... or horrifying.

151
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,360
Rob Reiner’s 1984 film This Is Spinal Tap
pokes fun at the self-serious rock documentaries

152
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,370
of its time.

153
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:13,660
One of its stars, Christopher Guest, has made
a career out of mockumentaries, from Waiting

154
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,330
for Guffman to Best in Show.

155
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:19,639
In 1999, directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo
Sánchez used the mockumentary form to scare

156
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,280
the pants off a generation of filmgoers with
The Blair Witch Project.

157
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,280
Wait that wasn't real? Nick?

158
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,280
Nick: No.

159
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,480
It was real.

160
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,578
And Lake Mungo, a 2008 psychological
thriller from Australia, uses documentary

161
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:36,449
techniques like interviews to excavate the
story of a family coming to terms with their

162
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,630
daughter’s drowning.

163
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,650
Documentaries have long borrowed fiction film
techniques as well, to recreate scenes and

164
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,270
weave them in with interviews and strict documentary
footage.

165
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:47,440
Master documentarian Errol Morris made The
Thin Blue Line in 1988 about a man on death

166
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,340
row for a crime he didn’t commit.

167
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:53,320
His cinematic recreations of the crime launched
a wave of true-crime docu-series on television.

168
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,920
These days there’s no shortage of cinematic
documentaries – like the incredible visuals

169
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:01,640
of Werner Herzog’s Into the Inferno, the
immersive 2015 film The Birth of Saké, and

170
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,450
the heartbreaking narrative of Fire at Sea,
which examines the 2016 European refugee crisis.

171
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:12,040
And in 2017, the sequel to the BBC’s astounding
Planet Earth series captivated audiences all over again.

172
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,880
Whether we see them on the big screen or a
small one, even today documentaries maintain

173
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,210
the power to inform, entertain, and move us
in profound ways.

174
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:23,450
Today we talked about the emergence of experimental
film as an alternative to mainstream narrative

175
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:24,450
fiction filmmaking.

176
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:29,160
We examined strategies that experimental films
use to convey meaning and evoke thoughts and emotions.

177
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,040
And we briefly discussed the history of documentary
films and how they have influenced – and

178
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,410
been influenced by – fiction films.

179
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:38,270
Next time, we’ll shift gears and look at
fiction film production, beginning with the

180
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,941
script and the screenwriter.

181
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,240
And you’ll be getting a new host, actress
and overall awesome human being, Lily Gladstone.

182
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,880
I guess this is goodbye, Beardlovers.

183
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,600
Crash Course Film History is produced in association with PBS Digital Studios.

184

186
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,640
This episode of Crash Course was filmed in
the Doctor Cheryl C. Kinney Crash Course Studio
