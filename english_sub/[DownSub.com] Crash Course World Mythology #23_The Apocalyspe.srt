00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
Hey there. I'm Mike Rugnetta.
This is Crash Course Mythology and

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:08,320
Today we'll be talking about the moment that you've all been waiting for... or perhaps dreading.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,560
That's right Thoth, it's the end of the world.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,320
These days books and movies and video games are big on post-Apocalypse stories

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,720
A  Nuclear Fallout, Zombies, Robot uprisings...

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,600
Nuclear-Powered robot zombie uprisings...

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,100
but before there were post apocalypse stories, there were plain old apocalypse stories.

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:32,180
What's an apocalypse? Well, it's a fancy way of saying "the end of the world," but often with

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,940
a religious connotation. So yes, fair warning, the apocalyptic visions we're discussing

10
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,220
come from living religious texts, and as usual,

11
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:46,460
We're not going to touch on their religious significance, but these stories do fit our definition of myth:

12
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,980
So let's get started, with
all of these endings.

13
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:04,480
(Theme Music)

14
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:10,020
We can find stories of the end of the world in cultures around the globe, and perhaps that's because

15
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:16,400
they reflect the uncomfortable fact that for individual people the world does come to an end

16
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,500
(in a sense)

17
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:24,980
When we, you know, die, but apocalypses are about more than any individual death, they're about imagining

18
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:31,100
how a supernatural power will eventually end all human life in its entirety.

19
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:45,100
According to our old pal David Leeming:

20
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,480
This theme of Divine punishment is similar to what we saw in all those flood stories:

21
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,720
China, Mesopotamia, the Inca Empire...
but there's one significant difference.

22
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:58,620
Flood stories are about the past,
but Apocalypse stories...

23
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,220
(apocalypse comes from a greek word for
uncovering, by the w)

24
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:07,180
always reveal something yet to come. This makes talking about them a little strange,

25
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:15,020
because they're old stories rooted in the past, which discuss a distant 'glob only knows when' future.

26
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,680
What we'll see today is the
flood story theme of judgment,

27
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,740
combined with the focus on torment for those
harshly judged, and in many cases

28
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,300
(just like the flood stories)

29
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,080
These end of everything tales actually promise a new beginning.

30
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,000
There's more than one tale of apocalypse in the Hebrew Bible foretold by a number of prophets

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,620
in some of these prophecies the end of the world is marked by two events:

32
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,940
First:

33
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,480
usually of the natural world, followed by:

34
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,220
a judgement punishing the enemies of God.

35
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,100
We're going to see these themes repeated,
again and again.

36
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,120
The book of Isaiah describes the promised Destruction:

37
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,600
The book of Zachariah has a little bit more detail
about how the judgment will work itself out

38
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,480
"Amid the destruction of the world the people of Jerusalem will be embroiled in a great battle"

39
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:16,400
"But the Lord himself will go forth to sway the battle and save his righteous followers"

40
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,040
and those on the other side of the battle? The 'non-righteous' you might be wondering, well:

41
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,580
:O

42
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,000
Anyone who manages to survive the
literal face-melting...

43
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:39,860
"The Lord will put a 'great tumult' among them leaving
all the non-believers to...

44
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:44,900
...fight each other as the world
burns down around them."

45
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,940
For the true believers in Yahweh, the prophecy promises

46
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,860
"safety and survival in the kingdom of God"

47
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,740
This is an apocalyptic attribute that we're going to see more than once today:

48
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,200
'if you got faith, you safe'

49
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,660
For the ancient Persians, or Astrians,
the ultimate deity Ahura Mazda has

50
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:03,200
a destructive counterpart in Angra Mainyu or 'Ahriman.'

51
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,920
In their apocalypse prophecy your fate is tied to which one you follow;

52
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,900
The many followers of Ahriman will be punished while the few faithful to Ahura Mazda will be rewarded

53
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:21,820
According to David Leeming:

54
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,100
Saoshyant, who's referred to as a single figure sometimes, and other times is a group of figures

55
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:50,920
is a kind of Messiah who will help remake
the world and redeem worthy Humankind

56
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,540
in some traditions the Saoshyant is also a product of
a virgin birth, but this story involves...

57
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,600
bathing in a lake filled with sperm. Lake of sperm aside, maybe you're picking up on some similarities?

58
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,160
There was a great deal of syncretism among the religions of the Eastern Mediterranean

59
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,160
Which brings us to the Christian apocalypse.
The end of the world is described in the

60
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,360
book of Revelation. It portrays the coming of the kingdom of God to Earth, the raising of the dead and

61
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:21,460
the last judgement. We got angels and antichrist, plagues, this end of days has it all come on down...

62
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,840
to the thought bubble. Amid all the Chaos at the end of days, Saint John Devine described in particular detail

63
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,900
the alchemical plagues of Seven Angels. He writes:

64
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,840
The seven angels appear, each holding their own vial of Plague liquid.

65
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,860
One by one they pour them out across the land the first angel pours their vial and

66
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,400
"There fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men...

67
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,840
...which had the mark of the beast...

68
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,140
...and upon them which worshiped His image"

69
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:04,180
The second angel pours their vial into the sea, which turns into blood.

70
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:09,220
The third angel pours a vial on the rivers and fountains, which also turn into blood.

71
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:15,600
The fourth Angel pours their vial into the sun, which flares up and scorches those on the face of the Earth

72
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:22,220
Angel five pours a vial on the seat of the beast. This fills their kingdom with darkness, and causes

73
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,800
their followers to gnaw their own tongues in pain.

74
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,300
The sixth angel pours their vial on the great river Euphrates and,

75
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:34,780
in kind of a twist the river doesn't turn into blood,
but it does dry up entirely.

76
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:39,040
The final Angel pours out their liquid into the air which causes

77
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,540
a great booming voice to come from the temple of heaven saying

78
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:43,720
IT

79
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,460
IS

80
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,980
DONE

81
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,240
There's thunder, lightning, and a terrible earthquake,

82
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,820
and all the remaining cities all the
nations of Earth crumble, and fall.

83
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,980
Thank you, thought bubble?

84
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:00,400
The apocalypse story in Revelation has a lot in common with the older prophecy Told by Zachariah.

85
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,740
Plagues, war, the dissolving of terrestrial nations...
but there's one very significant difference

86
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,580
which is that Revelation makes frequent
reference to 'The Beast,'

87
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,640
Saint John has added a villain similar to
what we saw in Zoroastrianism.

88
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,880
Of course, the villain stuff gets complicated because there are actually two beasts...

89
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,720
And a dragon yes, there is also a dragon

90
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,680
So I guess that means that there are then three beasts? Also The Dragon is the devil.

91
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,260
The last story of apocalypse that we're going to talk about comes from

92
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:32,820
Islam and since Islam is also an Abrahamic tradition, It's unsurprising that there are similarities between

93
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,070
Jewish Christian and Muslim accounts of the end of the world

94
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:40,299
There's a long description of the final judgment in Sura 56 of the Quran

95
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,540
But there's also interesting additional information;

96
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:48,400
recorded in a collection of 'hadith' which are sayings and stories of the life of Mohammad

97
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,080
It's worth noting that while this is a religious text in Islam,

98
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,940
It's considered a secondary text to the Koran and not all collections of Hadith are equally esteemed.

99
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,180
Muslims have a variety of relationships with the hadith often depending upon their denomination,

100
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:09,040
and how well sourced a given hadith is. Here at crash course Mythology were interested in stories,

101
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,200
which is why we're drawing on this particular hadith, but if you want to know more you can

102
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:18,480
check out the two episodes of crash course world history about Islam that cover this very topic.

103
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:23,300
When asked about the judgment that's mentioned in the Quran, Mohammad offers further explanation:

104
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:30,000
He says that at this terrible time people will forsake studying the quran and indulge in Earthly pleasures.

105
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:35,130
There will be famine and plague in Medina and Mecca earthquakes throughout North Africa

106
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,708
Thunderstorms in Iran and Turkey,

107
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,359
banditry in Iraq and floods in the far East.

108
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:48,200
As morality decays among all the people the Dajjal or antichrist will appear riding on a donkey and

109
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:55,400
Subjecting all the people to his rule. Dajjal's rule, not the donkeys rule. The Dajjal will rule for only 40 days though,

110
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,040
before God sends Jesus and an army of
the Faithful from Heaven.

111
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:06,020
Jesus will defeat and kill the Dajjal and then rain for 40 years, but each of these years will have

112
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,500
26 months, so it'll be more like 87 years.

113
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,380
At that point, Jesus will travel to Jerusalem, pray at the dome of the rock,

114
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:19,580
And be taken up to heaven. And this is where things
get intense: Seven days after Jesus ascends

115
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:24,120
the monsters Ya'juj and Ma'juj (referred to in the old
and new Testaments as Gog and Magog)

116
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,260
will escape their bondage and destroy civilization,

117
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,480
then the angel Israphel will blow the horn of judgment,

118
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:35,760
Mountains will crumble, there will be 40 more years of earthquakes and terrible storms then

119
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:41,880
Israphel will sound the horn again, the souls and bodies of the faithful will be reunited,

120
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,980
resurrected and spend the next 40 years praising Allah.

121
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:52,280
After this final 40 year period the trumpet will sound again and Mohammad will return to Earth,

122
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,920
for the day of judgment.

123
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,520
Everyone will have their secret sins measured against their good deeds on the scales of judgment,

124
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:05,040
the Allah will tip the scales if one of the damned sincerely calls for mercy

125
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,580
and finally all will walk to cross the bridge into paradise

126
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:16,200
easy and wide for the righteous while the damned can't help but slip off and fall below into hell

127
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,790
But even if they do fall into hell,

128
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:22,220
If they really have a change of heart along the way they'll be able to scramble out in time.

129
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,389
There's always hope for things to turn around.

130
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:28,800
So these apocalypse stories feature plagues and natural disasters,

131
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,660
things far beyond mortal control and let's not forget the unnatural disasters,

132
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:39,640
like rivers of molten metal or the Dragons; not nice ones interested in responding or helping with floods either.

133
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:46,500
And yet, these apocalypse stories mix terror with hope! As in flood myths, apocalypse stories from the

134
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,620
religious traditions of the Eastern Mediterranean all offer some sense of an everlasting life,

135
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,340
beyond this world. At least, for believers. If they speak to the end of the world they also speak to

136
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:03,140
the faithful in the present moment, promising great rewards, or amnesty from everlasting torment,

137
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:09,059
if that faith continues. But, let's hope the world is an end too soon at least not before we get to talk about

138
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Ragnarok!
