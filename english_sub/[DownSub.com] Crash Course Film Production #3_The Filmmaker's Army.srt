1
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,180
Making a film can seem... daunting.

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,740
After you have a screenplay and have done
your pre-production, you still have to film the thing.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,060
And you’re gonna need help.

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:14,540
Orson Welles once said, “A writer needs
a pen, an artist needs a brush, but a filmmaker

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,540
needs an army.”

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,730
But he also co-wrote, produced, directed,
and starred in Citizen Kane.

7
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:19,730
So which is it?

8
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:24,260
Do you need hundreds of people, or a couple
of disciplined artists doing everything?

9
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,920
Well, It depends on your movie.

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,140
Every successful film production has the same
kinds of jobs, but the scale can vary a lot.

11
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,660
Every story has different needs.

12
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,040
And maybe the best place to start sizing up
the needs of your project is in the inner

13
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,110
workings of a film set, where the actual filming
takes place.

14
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,570
And then of course there are the people – the
crew that work on and off set during principal

15
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,700
photography, when most of the movie is being
filmed.

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,520
I'm Lily Gladstone, and this is Crash Course Film Production.

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:01:00,340
[Intro Music Plays]

18
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,720
Some people refer to different positions in
a film crew as “above the line” or “below the line.”

19
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,359
This idea is a holdover from the studio days,
when budgets on paper had a literal line between

20
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:10,359
different jobs.

21
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:14,090
The people “above the line,” like writers,
directors, producers, and certain actors,

22
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,049
negotiated payment before shooting began.

23
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:18,599
And those “below the line” were paid a
rate for every day they worked.

24
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,140
If we’re sticking with Orson Welles’ analogy,
everyone “below the line” is a filmmaker’s army.

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,659
The General of that army is the Unit Production
Manager, or UPM.

26
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:31,070
Usually, the director picks key creative roles
to support the vision of the film, like the

27
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,149
production designer and cinematographer

28
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:37,140
But the UPM is responsible for hiring everyone
else and managing all the moving parts of a production.

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,140
They oversee pre-production, from picking
locations to planning out the shooting schedule.

30
00:01:41,149 --> 00:01:43,249
And sometimes they’re on set when a scene
is being filmed.

31
00:01:43,249 --> 00:01:44,249
But not always.

32
00:01:44,249 --> 00:01:47,590
They might be checking in with the Art Department
to make sure sets are ready for the next day’s

33
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,899
shoot, or visiting the Production Office to
work with someone like the production accountant,

34
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:52,270
who makes sure everyone gets paid.

35
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:56,240
The UPM is also the point of contact for any
local authorities and companies the production

36
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,240
is working with.

37
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,149
Now, the person running a film set is the
head of the Production Department: the 1st

38
00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:02,909
Assistant Director, or 1st AD.

39
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,539
They work with the director to schedule the
details of each day’s shoot and communicate

40
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:08,098
what every department needs to do.

41
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,479
Plus, they’re responsible for keeping everyone
safe.

42
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,080
If you’ve ever visited a film set and saw
someone you thought was the director, it

43
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,340
was probably the 1st AD.

44
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,879
They’re the ones “calling the roll”
to tell people to do specific things at specific

45
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,000
moments – shouting things like “roll sound,”
“roll camera,” and sometimes even “Action!”

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,860
While the 1st AD is always on set, the 2nd
Assistant Director, or 2nd AD, is usually

47
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,659
at base camp, which is just off set.

48
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:32,030
Base camp is the behind-the-scenes of the
behind-the-scenes.

49
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,790
It’s usually where the crew eats lunch,
where the bathrooms are, and where the department

50
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:36,819
and actor trailers are.

51
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:41,300
The 2nd AD is the main point of contact between
the set and the actors when they’re not acting.

52
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,180
They make the daily call sheet, which is the
document that tells everyone in the cast and

53
00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:48,630
crew where they need to be, when, and who
they report to the next day.

54
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:53,010
When a scene has extras, or background talent,
the 2nd AD may go on set to work with these actors.

55
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,560
They also oversee the rest of the production
hierarchy – any other ADs, and Production Assistants.

56
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,680
We call them P.A.s.

57
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,790
PAs are the lowest rung on this ladder, but
they’re still super important.

58
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:06,269
There’s a pretty good chance that everyone
on a set has been a PA at some point.

59
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:10,660
Their main job is anticipating needs and communicating
between departments, like by making sure everyone

60
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,530
hears all the 1st AD’s calls.

61
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,370
So, the production team is the glue that holds
the film set and all the crew together.

62
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,290
And there are a bunch of departments.

63
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,580
Let’s start with the Camera Department.

64
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:23,930
The person responsible for the look of the
film is the Director of Photography, or DP,

65
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,459
also called the cinematographer.

66
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:29,370
They work with the director to translate the
script into a shot list, which is a plan for

67
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,769
how to visually convey every single scene.

68
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:34,290
The 1st AD uses the shot list to plan the
daily schedule.

69
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,760
On an independent film, the cinematographer
might also be the camera operator.

70
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,400
But, usually, the cinematographer directs
the camera crew, which includes operators

71
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:43,260
and camera assistants, or ACs.

72
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,159
While ACs aren’t actually framing shots
and operating the camera, the First AC helps

73
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:50,010
focus the camera, so they’re sometimes
known as the Focus Puller.

74
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,480
ACs also maintain equipment and keep camera
notes for continuity.

75
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,549
Cinematographers need to understand story,
cameras, and lighting to pack a visual punch.

76
00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:00,779
So they work with the Gaffer, also known as
the Chief Lighting Technician.

77
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,540
They’re the head of the Electric Department,
and design and implement the lighting of each scene.

78
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:08,100
The Gaffer’s second-in-command is called
the Best Boy or Best Boy Electric – no matter

79
00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:09,109
their gender.

80
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:12,389
Both the titles “Gaffer” and “Best Boy”
have been around since at least the 1930s,

81
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:14,970
but it’s unclear how the names came to mean
“head electricians.”

82
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,608
On smaller crews, the Electric Department
might be just a Gaffer and a Best Boy.

83
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:22,740
But on larger crews, these two might organize
dozens of electricians and lots of equipment.

84
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,180
And you can’t talk about Electric without
talking about the Grip Department.

85
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,949
These departments are close buddies, and are
sometimes called G&E.

86
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:33,800
While Electric oversees lighting and getting
power to the set, Grip oversees all the rigging for lights.

87
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,220
That includes all stands for lights as well
as flags, silks, and nets, which are fabric

88
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,610
used to control or block light.

89
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,990
Grip also handles specialized rigging for
other departments too, like cranes, dollies,

90
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,050
and dolly track, which help with specific
camera movements.The Key Grip leads the team,

91
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,860
and their number two is the Best Boy Grip,
who carries out the Key Grip’s plans for rigging.

92
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,740
G&E is often the largest department on set
during filming.

93
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,080
But the smallest department is only one person:
the Script Supervisor, or “scripty,” who’s

94
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,440
in charge of – you guessed it – the script.

95
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,340
Here at Crash Course, we call them "Supes."

96
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,470
They make sure the actors stay true to the
writer’s dialogue.

97
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:09,500
So if you ever hear an actor call “line,”
they probably forgot what to say and are asking

98
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,050
the Script Supervisor for help.

99
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,800
This department is also called Continuity
because the “scripty” is responsible for

100
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,650
thinking ahead to how the editor will cut
everything together.

101
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,889
To hear all the words being said, the script
supervisor needs to work with the Sound Department.

102
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:25,610
The head is the Sound Recordist, or Sound
Mixer, whose job is to hear everything.

103
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:29,680
They’re usually just off-set, monitoring
sound in a slightly quieter place.

104
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,970
They manage the boom operator, who’s on
set and trying to get the microphone as close

105
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,690
as possible to the actors’ mouths without
being in the shot.

106
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,190
Now, all the departments we’ve talked about
so far are involved in capturing the film.

107
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:44,940
But there are a bunch that work both on and
off set to create the world that’s being captured.

108
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,979
The Art Department, for instance, designs,
builds, or transforms sets, finds and creates

109
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:52,759
props, and dresses each location to match
the director’s vision for each scene.

110
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:56,450
Their fearless leader is the Production Designer,
who works with the director in pre-production

111
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,919
to create the look of the world.

112
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,940
Then, the Art Director organizes everyone
else and makes the Production Designer’s

113
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,940
plans real.

114
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,729
Everything in the mise-en-scène is found
or made by the Art Department.

115
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:09,130
So the more complex a film is, the larger
the team tends to be.

116
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:13,419
Similarly, the Wardrobe Department is responsible
for channeling the themes of the film, time

117
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:17,129
period, setting, and character traits into
the clothing of each character in each scene.

118
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:20,590
Even if it looks like someone doesn’t have
any costume changes, they probably have different

119
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:24,290
versions of the same outfit – like a bloody
shirt, or ripped pants – depending on what

120
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,290
happens in the film.

121
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,319
The Costume Designer is responsible for pre-production
planning.

122
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,410
While everything on set and in the wardrobe
trailer is overseen by the Costume Supervisor.

123
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:36,490
Set costumers dress and undress actors before
and after shooting, paying close attention

124
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:37,780
to continuity between scenes.

125
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,780
And to complement Wardrobe, there’s Hair
and MakeUp, or HMU, which tend to get lumped

126
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,870
together as one department.

127
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:46,870
Of all the crew, Wardrobe and HMU spend the
most one-on-one time with actors, and play

128
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:50,440
an important role in making them feel safe
and confident while doing their work.

129
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,639
A film with a very small cast might have one
person who does all the makeup and hair styling,

130
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,870
while larger casts might have an HMU artist
for each lead actor.

131
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,569
Most makeup artists can make people look really
good or bad or rough, depending on what a

132
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:02,569
scene calls for.

133
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:07,030
And if a film needs a lot of specialized makeup,
like scars for a war or full-on monster faces,

134
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,060
then you call a Special Effects MakeUp Artist.

135
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,000
They’re the bridge between HMU and the Special
Effects Department, which is led by the Special

136
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,289
Effects Supervisor.

137
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:18,750
Special Effects is in charge of every on-set
effect, from creating artificial snow or rain,

138
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,470
to orchestrating a car crash or an epic explosion.

139
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:25,199
I’ve mentioned safety before, but it’s
worth repeating over and over again.

140
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,400
Especially when we’re talking about special
effects or stunts, which are cast and choreographed

141
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,599
by the Stunt Coordinator.

142
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,740
Before potentially-dangerous scenes, the 1st AD will repeat all the general safety instructions on set.

143
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,840
Then, either the Special Effects Supervisor
or Stunt Coordinator will talk through what

144
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,680
should happen, and what everyone should
do if something goes wrong.

145
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,270
Most crews will have at least one trained
Set Medic, like an EMT.

146
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:48,629
Or a special team might be brought in, if
a potentially dangerous scene is being filmed.

147
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:51,259
Now, we’ve talked about almost everyone
you might find on a set.

148
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:55,240
But where the set is changes throughout
a film – thanks to the Locations Department.

149
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,479
In pre-production, the scout will search for
places to film, based on the script and practicality.

150
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,960
Once the director and producers approve of
the locations, the department keys will go

151
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,759
on a “tech scout” to make sure they can
do their work, too.

152
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,110
What we see on-screen is actually just one
small part of the location!

153
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,909
The location manager and location assistants
plan where everything will go, from the set

154
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,930
that will appear on camera to all the trailers
in base camp.

155
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,910
They’re first to arrive and last to leave.

156
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:21,940
The second people to arrive are usually drivers
in the Transportation Department, which is

157
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,569
overseen by the Transportation Manager.

158
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:27,139
They get all the large equipment and trailers
to the set, and shuttle cast and crew

159
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,139
back and forth.

160
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,360
Obviously, the more people you have, the bigger
the team you’ll need.

161
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,039
And, speaking of big teams, the one job that
should never be forgotten, is actually two jobs.

162
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,579
And it’s feeding all these people!
Catering companies are contracted by the UPM

163
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,890
to cook 1 to 3 meals per day.

164
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:44,840
And the Craft Service person is the crew member
that manages a station of snacks and drinks

165
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,840
on set.

166
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,930
Both the person and station can be affectionately
called “Crafty.”

167
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,960
During a difficult day of shooting, “Crafty”
might be the only thing keeping you going.

168
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,910
The power of a granola bar and a friendly
face should never be underestimated!

169
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,610
Like, ever.

170
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:00,320
Seriously, feed your cast and crew.

171
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,700
And make sure you're paying attention to allergy and dietary restrictions.

172
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,680
No one is doing that to be high maintenance.

173
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,720
Crewing a film set is demanding work, but
it’s work that attracts people who really

174
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
love it.

175
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,470
We could easily make a 90-minute video about
all these talented people… but, y’know,

176
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,470
scale!

177
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,700
Today we discussed scalability and how the
needs of a film dictate the size of a film crew.

178
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,980
We learned about the different departments
and jobs on a set and how they interact.

179
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:26,040
And next time, we’ll start diving into these
roles in more detail, starting with that piece

180
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,130
of equipment at the center of every set: the
camera.

181
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:32,090
Crash Course Film Production is produced in
association with PBS Digital Studios.

182
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:35,440
You can head over to their channel to check
out a playlist of their latest shows, like

183
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,970
PBS Infinite Series, Deep Look, and Brain
Craft.

184
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,760
This episode of Crash Course was filmed in
the Doctor Cheryl C. Kinney Crash Course Studio

185
00:09:42,760 --> 00:00:00,000
with the help of these nice people and our
amazing graphics team is Thought Cafe.
