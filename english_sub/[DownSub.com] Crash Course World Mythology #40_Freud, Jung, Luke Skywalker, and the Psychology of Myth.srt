00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,110
Hi.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:04,690
I’m Mike Rugnetta, this is Crashcourse Mythology
and today we’re going to lay mythology down

3
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:09,759
on this comfy little couch over here and listen
to all its problems.

4
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,450
It’s time to get all psychology on mythology.

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,219
We’ll be examining the theories of both
Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, and discussing

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:20,640
the curious relationship the works of both
men have to mythology.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,750
So, Thoth, how do you feel about your mother?

8
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,550
OH, that’s right - you created your self.

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,850
Or did you spring from Set’s forehead?

10
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,160
Or was it Ra’s heart?

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,070
ANYWAY - we’re talking about Freud and Jung
for two main reasons.

12
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,230
The first is that they used myths in their
practice.

13
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:41,440
They relied on ancient stories to describe
the contemporary psychological conditions

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,190
they observed and would often relate what
their patients told them to mythological stories.

15
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:50,460
And the second is that we can use some of
their theories to explore and analyze myth

16
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,710
itself, just like we applied Joseph Campbell’s
theories in our exploration of hero myths.

17
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,660
And let’s not forget that Campbell’s theories
owe a lot to Jung.

18
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,950
[[[Thoth holding up a sign that says Forever
Jung?]]]

19
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:03,950
Rod Stewart gag, huh?

20
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:11,650
You been hanging out with Stan too much, my
dude.

21
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:16,190
INTRO
Freud and Jung were contemporaries and the

22
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:21,820
two of them were hugely influential in establishing
psychology and psychoanalysis in the 20th

23
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:22,820
century.

24
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,290
Freud started writing in the 1890s, and is
generally considered the father of psychoanalysis,

25
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:32,790
which in turn, has influenced almost all of
our pop culture representations of what psychology

26
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,630
or therapy or even THE MIND look like.

27
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:41,250
Freud and Jung both believed that our dreams
-- the stories our minds create without our

28
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,890
active input -- were keys to understanding
our waking selves and the problems we experienced.

29
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,350
For a lot of his career, Freud thought that
most of our problems had a single root: The

30
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,350
Oedipus.

31
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,510
You’ve probably heard the phrase “oedipal
complex.”

32
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:59,400
This is a classic, and well known, example
of how Freud was influenced by mythology.

33
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,850
He used the Greek myth of Oedipus to help
illustrate a particular theory he had about

34
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:07,900
why so many rich 19th-century Viennese people
were so neurotic.

35
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:12,070
We’ve covered the myth in Crash Course Literature,
but basically: Oedipus is a Greek prince who’s

36
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:17,510
the subject of a prophecy which says one day
he will kill his father and marry his mother.

37
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:23,200
He does everything he can to avoid this, only
years later, to sort of accidentally kill

38
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,640
his father, the king Laius, and sort of accidentally
marry his mother, the queen Jocasta.

39
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,580
And less accidentally sort of have a bunch
of incest kids.

40
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:36,870
Freud borrowed Oedipus’ name to help explain
his theory that young boys have a natural

41
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,570
desire to replace their fathers and bed their
mothers.

42
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:45,120
Freud argued that so many other hang-ups and
emotions derive from this “complex.”

43
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,379
Now, maybe you’re thinking: I don’t want
to sleep with my mother, or, I’m not a boy,

44
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,730
so how does this apply to me?

45
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,480
And you would be right to have those questions.

46
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,420
There are definitely… assumptions in some
of Freud’s theories.

47
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:04,370
But like it or not, those theories have shaped
and influenced huge swaths of twentieth century

48
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,370
western culture.

49
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:08,540
And we haven’t even talked about his theory
of penis envy.

50
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,709
And--ooh, look at the time, better keep moving.

51
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:14,650
Carl Gustav Jung was, at one time, Freud’s
friend and collaborator.

52
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:18,150
And like Freud, Jung is a towering figure
in the history of psychology.

53
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,840
One of his best-known techniques was a way
of analyzing dreams.

54
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,900
Jung believed that dreams could be understood
through “archetypes.”

55
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:33,030
He defined archetypes as those figures or
concepts that occur across cultures and history,

56
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,030
shared, in essence amongst all people.

57
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:41,750
“There are as many archetypes as there are
typical situations in life,” he once wrote.

58
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:47,420
Jung believed Archetypes helped us understand
the world, and explain not only our dreams,

59
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,519
but also the common aspects of dreams among
many people.

60
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,629
According to Jung, human beings everywhere
are born with the ability to draw archetypes

61
00:03:56,629 --> 00:04:02,020
from a sort of super-psychic aether, and form
them into an individually useful language

62
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,470
of storytelling and meaning.

63
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:10,340
This aether is known as the “collective
unconscious,” and is one potential explanation

64
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,530
for why there are so many commonalities in
myths throughout the world.

65
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:20,269
Jung thought archetypes, in dreams and stories
alike, were one key to better understanding

66
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:22,099
our own lives.

67
00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:28,229
If Jung used archetypes as a way to analyze
dreams, he drew on myths depicted in stories

68
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:32,009
and art to figure out what those archetypes
were.

69
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:36,089
Stories of heroes and witches and tricksters
and maidens help inform the archetypes that

70
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:41,699
Jung established, which he in turn used to
explore the psychology of his patients.

71
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:47,069
He considered a person’s psyche to be an
individual manifestation of elements taken

72
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:50,939
from the collective unconscious, elements
also often found in myth.

73
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:54,879
By taking ideas from different myths, and
using their widely accepted meaning to look

74
00:04:54,879 --> 00:05:00,159
analytically at our dreams, we can better
understand our own psyche.

75
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:05,909
And if we want to, we can also plug some of
Jung’s ideas back into myths to better understand

76
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:06,909
how they work.

77
00:05:06,909 --> 00:05:12,099
Jung discussed a lot of archetypes, but we’re
going to focus on three big ones he thought

78
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:14,199
were part of every individual.

79
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:21,249
If an individual, or a hero of myth, can integrate
them all successfully it means a fusion between

80
00:05:21,249 --> 00:05:27,080
the conscious mind, the personal unconscious
AND the collective unconscious.

81
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,120
That means--wait for it--an integrated self!

82
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,189
Got it?

83
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:37,050
And hey, fun bonus fact: this individuation
isn’t necessarily an end state; people can

84
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,169
go through it numerous times.

85
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:44,919
The three archetypes we’re looking at are
the shadow, anima/animus, and the self.

86
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:50,110
The shadow is a part of our unconscious mind
and represents all the parts of a person they

87
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,930
don’t like to acknowledge.

88
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:58,039
This includes less socially acceptable emotions
like rage or sexual desire or survival instincts.[1]

89
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:00,379
Think of it as your hidden side.

90
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:03,559
Sort of like a reverse image of your conscious
self.

91
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:08,399
In dreams and myths, though, the shadow is
always the same gender as the protagonist

92
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,399
or dreamer.

93
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:13,619
And yeah, Jung has a tendency to break things
down along gender lines and make a lot of

94
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:15,949
assumptions based on those.

95
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:18,180
Today this can feel anachronistic.

96
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,580
And pretty patriarchal.

97
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,819
Something to keep in mind while we learn about
it.

98
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:27,349
Next, the anima or animus: archetypes that
likewise comprise an aspect of the protagonist’s

99
00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:29,929
self in their unconscious mind.

100
00:06:29,929 --> 00:06:34,800
Women have an animus, which represents their
male side while men have an anima representing

101
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,460
their female side.

102
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:43,069
Both are aspects of the collective unconscious–avatars
for gender essentialism, kind of.

103
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:48,090
Jung didn’t consider them artifacts of our
specific relationships with family members

104
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:52,199
of the opposite sex though, which CAN have
an impact on us, but in a different way.

105
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:57,860
The anima and -mus, rather, represent a sort
of negation more even deeply held than what

106
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,569
is represented by our SHADOW.

107
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:08,439
For men, their anima personifies their “feminine”
characteristics like moodiness, intuition,

108
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:09,879
and irrationality.

109
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:13,649
YEESH - because obviously men are never irrational
or moody.

110
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:20,509
For women, the animus represents “male”
qualities like aggression, ferocity, risk-taking,

111
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:26,139
and according to one scholar of Jung, “silent,
obstinate, evil ideas.”[2] Though, the animus,

112
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:31,090
they say, can also help women take action,
speak out and find wisdom.

113
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:35,240
Because ladies… need a lot of help with
that kind of thing, right?

114
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,240
ALSO YEESH.

115
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,169
The last archetype is the Self.

116
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:45,149
Not like, your actual self, but a character
that represents a total and timeless unification

117
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:47,979
of your conscious and unconscious parts.

118
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:52,839
So sort of a superego, but also your link
to the collective unconscious, too.

119
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,779
The Self does a lot of work.

120
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:58,839
The Self will once again be the same gender
as the, uh, self?

121
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:03,569
Typically, it’s a wise old man, sometimes
called a senex, for men.

122
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:07,409
And for women, a crone, although that term
isn’t as judgy as it sounds.

123
00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:12,899
Having integrated our primitive self, represented
by the shadow, and our emotional opposite,

124
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:17,689
represented by the anima or animus, we have
gained a greater awareness of ourselves and

125
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:20,789
of our participation in the collective unconscious.

126
00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:25,479
The integration and awareness that the Self
represents is the point of the journey, whether

127
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:28,569
it’s a mythical journey or a psychological
one.

128
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:33,349
Once the hero–having passed all their psychic
trials–can accept and acknowledge the archetype

129
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:37,219
of the self, he or she has gained a kind of
maturity.

130
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:41,328
And the same could be true for each of us
in the journey of our own lives.

131
00:08:41,328 --> 00:08:45,890
Jungian archetypes can seem [DRAMATIC PAUSE]
abstract.

132
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:51,009
To make them feel more concrete, let’s use
them to retell a contemporary myth almost

133
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:52,490
all of us know: Star Wars!

134
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,629
Take it away, Thoughtbubble.

135
00:08:53,629 --> 00:09:00,680
A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away
lived a young dreamer named Luke Skywalker.

136
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:07,250
He begins his process of individuation in
total boredom on a desolate planet devoid

137
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,470
of meaning.

138
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:14,360
Then, into his life comes a Shadow, with an
awesome black cloak: Darth Vader.

139
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:21,050
Powerful and cruel, Darth Vader could be seen
as representing the harsher, angrier, more

140
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:27,180
animalistic emotions that Luke will not let
himself express.

141
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:34,480
Not long after, Luke meets another Shadow
in a dangerous bar.

142
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,730
This Shadow, named Han, is cocky where Luke
is unassuming, skilled at fighting where Luke

143
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:46,079
is a novice, and above all worldly, where
Luke is naïve.

144
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:51,050
Luke and Han don’t get along at first; in
fact Luke finds many aspects of Han unpleasant,

145
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,250
especially his selfishness.

146
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:59,740
But eventually the two come to respect each
other, mainly once Luke acknowledges his own

147
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,480
aggression and learns to control it.

148
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,899
Soon Luke finds his Anima in the form of a
powerful princess with rad hair.

149
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:11,170
Initially, Princess Leia is an object of sexual
desire for the young man.

150
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:16,230
But she’s also a guide, providing Luke with
the motivation to leave his home.

151
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:20,440
And she leads him to his Senex: Obi Wan Kenobi.

152
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:26,040
Obi Wan helps Luke reconcile with his Anima,
establishing a loving relationship with her.

153
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:31,550
Later, an even more powerful Senex, Yoda,
the small green Jedi Master with odd sentence

154
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,170
structure, he meets.

155
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:39,480
Both Senexes, teach Luke the ways of the Force,
an elemental power that pervades all places

156
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,040
and all things.

157
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,130
Once Luke can acknowledge the shadow as a
hidden part of himself, accept the anima as

158
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:52,889
his opposite self, and accept the wisdom of
the Senex in forming his Self self, only then

159
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:57,550
does he achieve maturation - by becoming a
JEDI.

160
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,550
Thanks Thoughtbubble.

161
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:01,699
Who knew Jung was so applicable to outer space?

162
00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:03,290
Well, George Lucas did.

163
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:07,089
Because as we mentioned in our first episode
on the hero myth, Jung was a big influence

164
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:11,459
on Joseph Campbell who was a huge influence
on George Lucas.

165
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:15,139
Obviously the Star Wars movies are famous
for lots of reasons, but maybe we can attribute

166
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:20,509
some of their success to their ability to
tap into something we all share - something

167
00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:22,850
in the collective unconscious.

168
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:28,579
In Luke Skywalker’s transformation from
a whiny little boy to a confident Jedi, maybe

169
00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:32,269
we’re able to recognize our own experience
of growing up.

170
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:33,850
Though with more robots.

171
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:34,850
Probably.

172
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:39,290
They’re not always perfect, but if we use
Jung’s tools as a starting place to analyze

173
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:44,050
myths, and other popular stories, we can start
to see some of the deep structures that run

174
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,480
from one to the next.

175
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,079
Maybe we can also start to understand why
certain myths endure and why these are stories

176
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:53,040
we want to keep telling.

177
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,740
About our world.

178
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,110
About ourselves.

179
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,110
About our droids.

180
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:02,029
Next time we wrap up crash course mythology
by taking a look at how the language of myth

181
00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:05,149
has found its way into everyday speech!

182
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:06,441
Thanks for watching - see you then!

183
00:12:06,441 --> 00:12:07,441
Crash Course Mythology is filmed in the Chad
and Stacey Emigholz studio in Indianapolis,

184
00:12:07,441 --> 00:12:08,441
IN, and is produced with the help of all these
nice people.

185
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:09,441
Our animation team is Thought Café.

186
00:12:09,441 --> 00:12:10,441
Crash Course exists thanks to the generous
support of our patrons at Patreon.

187
00:12:10,441 --> 00:12:11,441

Crash Course free, for everyone, forever.

189
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:25,540

Wars we spoiled.
