00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,200
Hey there, I'm Mike. This is Crash Course Mythology, and today, we're gonna pick up where we left off last week, talking about sex.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:12,600
Mythological sex. Legendary sex! Sex that results in the creation of the world.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,400
There's also gonna be more castration, and also dwarfs

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,880
Stop hiding, Thoth! You can handle it.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,000
This time, we'll focus, not only on sex itself, but on a common side effect: children.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,320
Mostly adorable mythological babies, but there are also those who are self-begotten

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:35,200
Like our own Thoth, and also like Athena, Greek goddess of wisdom, who sprang fully-grown from the foreheads of their fathers.

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,080
Long before epidurals were invented too. Yeowch...

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:47,140
[Opening Theme]

10
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:54,780
Last week, we started with spitting, vomiting fathers, some of whom managed to pull of creation without any female counterpart.

11
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,160
In general, though, the world's creation myths include some kind of duality.

12
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,760
Whether it's that separation of male and female, light and dark, good and evil, or day and night

13
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,100
The idea of "Mother Earth" is a pretty common one in the west, and it's been remarkably persistent.

14
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:20,400
In fact, in the 1970s, British scientist James Lovelock updated the myth in a scientific hypothesis, defining "Mother Earth," Under her Greek name, Gaia, as:

15
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,680
So, let's begin with the mother of them all: Gaia.

16
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,100
According to Hesiod:

17
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:14,280
And a bunch of other supernatural beings, including Coeus, Crius, Theia, Rhea, Memory (Greek name Mnemosne)

18
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:22,840
Phoebe, Tethys, and most important for us in this episode, Cronus, God of Time, and... future castrator.

19
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,420
These beings are called the Titans

20
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:34,060
Gaia also bore the one-eyed cyclopses, and the Hecatoncheires, who were giants with a hundred arms, and fifty heads

21
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:42,580
That were so scary, that Heaven (Uranus) hid them away in a cavern, inside of Earth (Gaia), called Tartarus, which made Earth... angry.

22
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,600
But really, can you blame Heaven? Those are fifty faces only a mother could love...

23
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:55,700
Before we get into all the incest and castration that follows, let's pause and think about why people might want to characterize Earth as a mother, rather than a father.

24
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:01,080
One obvious answer is that, traditionally, mothers are the ones who give birth (unless we're talking about seahorses).

25
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,800
So it's not a huge stretch to think of creation as coming from mothers.

26
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:11,120
And mothers are nurturing, in the biological sense: that they provide physical food for infants.

27
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:20,200
By the same token, in agricultural societies, and probably hunter-gatherer and herding cultures too, the Earth provides the food that people and animals need to live.

28
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,800
So the metaphor of "Mother Earth" makes a lot of sense.

29
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:29,920
The mothers of myths aren't always the most doting, and they're often pretty powerful.

30
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,720
In many myths, they love their children a lot more than their husbands, who, to be fair, can be apocalyptically horrible.

31
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,640
Let's go back to the Greeks.

32
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:47,100
We saw in a previous episode what happened when Earth, or Gaia, was ticked off that Sky, AKA Ouranos, had locked up her fifty-headed children.

33
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:52,300
She gave a sickle to her son Cronus, who castrated his dad, and as a result, Aphrodite was born.

34
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:59,520
Surprisingly, Ouranos didn't harbor too many hard feelings, maybe because he and Gaia knew that it would soon be curtains for Cronus.

35
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,400
At the hands of his own children no less

36
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:08,100
We're gonna see this prophesy about a son overthrowing, or possibly even killing, his father... a lot.

37
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,420
And your parents were worried about your goth phase. Ugh...

38
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:18,440
Cronus, knowing what he had done to his own father, was understandably nervous about HIS children, born to his sister Rhea.

39
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,580
Again, incest, pretty common in cosmologies and pantheons...

40
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,400
Actually, maybe we can just have some kind of... Incest Alert, instead of me mentioning it every time it comes up?

41
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,040
Yeah. That's perfect. That's great

42
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,960
So, as each of his children were born, Cronus took them up, and swallowed them.

43
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,380
As Hesiod tells us:

44
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:51,520
In the same way that Gaia was upset about Ouranos imprisoning the Hecatoncheires, Rhea was not thrilled about Cronus eating all of her children.

45
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,000
So with the help of her parents, she came up with a plan.

46
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,540
When her son Zeus was about to be born, Rhea snuck off to Crete to give birth, and handed baby Zeus off to his grandma, Gaia

47
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:10,400
Rhea then wrapped a stone in a onesie, showed it to Cronus, who (no big surprise) grabbed the stone, and ate it.

48
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,880
Apparently he had very strong teeth, and also was somehow unfamiliar with the density of your standard baby, but hey. Okay.

49
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:22,680
Zeus grew up, and he set to work overthrowing his dad. and fulfilling the prophesy, 'cause that's how prophesies work.

50
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:29,140
Knowing that he needed help to unseat his father and the other Titans, and also to set his siblings free from daddy's tummy,

51
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:35,800
Zeus released those fifty-headed hecatoncheires, and together, they went to war.

52
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:42,900
He also freed Rhea's other children, and together, they defeated the Titans, and Zeus and his fam became the Gods of the Greeks.

53
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:51,120
Like I said, this idea of the son rising up to supplant the father, causing a war in Heaven, is pretty common in a number of creation stories.

54
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:58,080
For example, in the Norse creation myth from the Prose Edda, an old Norse text, we find the evil frost giant Ymir

55
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:08,160
Who not only created man and woman from his sweaty left armpit, which explains a lot when you think about it, but also created a family of frost giants.

56
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:17,400
And also also, somehow, another man named Búri, who has a son named Borr, who in turn married Bestla, the daughter of the frost giant Boelthor

57
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,300
Because, I guess alliteration was in the style at the time.

58
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,460
Bestla gave birth to three sons: Vili, Vé, and Odin.

59
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,540
So here's where the story gets really interesting. Thought Bubble?

60
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:34,760
The three brothers, Vili, Vé, and Odin, HATED Ymir and the other frost giants (even though they created them. Notice the emerging theme here?)

61
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:42,900
So then they battled and defeated them, killing Ymir, then the three gods used Ymir's body to create the world.

62
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,600
His flesh became Earth. His bones became mountains and stones.

63
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:55,280
His blood served well to make the lakes that dotted the world, and the seas that surrounded it, and his skull was used for the sky.

64
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:01,800
And, yes! This does sound a lot like the Chinese creation myth of P'an Ku, with a skull, instead of a cosmic egg.

65
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,060
But I guess god blood always turns into water... Anyway.

66
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:10,500
A dwarf stood at each of the four corners of the sky. The dwarfs were named East, West, North, and South

67
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:16,380
The gods made the sun and moon from the sparks of Múspell. To the giants, they assigned a place called Jotunheim

68
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:25,260
The brothers then created a fertile land called Midgard from Ymir's eyebrows, and they created a man from a fallen ash tree, and a woman from a fallen elm.

69
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:30,520
Odin gave them life, Vili gave them intelligence and emotions, and Vé gave them senses.

70
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,800
Ask was the man, and Embla was the woman.

71
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,800
These were the parents of the human race.

72
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:43,600
And because the Norse gods were very into upcycling, out of the maggots that had come from Ymir's rotting flesh, the gods made dwarfs.

73
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,500
More dwarfs!

74
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:51,160
As for the sons of Borr, they formed a family of gods and goddesses called the Æsir, led by the father god, Odin.

75
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:58,760
They built a wonderous home over Midgard, and called it Asgard. The two zones were linked by the rainbow bridge, Bifröst

76
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,600
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

77
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:07,920
We'll be hearing more about these gods of Asgard later, but right now, I want to use this myth as a "rainbow bridge," my favorite kind of bridge, to a similar creation story.

78
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:14,660
Fans of Crash Course World History know that we love the Epic of Gilgamesh, but there's another sacred text from that part of the world:

79
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:19,640
The Enuma Elish, from Babylonia, that gives us one of the worlds oldest creation stories

80
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,920
And hey, surprise, it features a war between younger gods and their parents.

81
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:30,620
As a bonus, it also has: primordial waters, an angry mother goddess, and a big bad creator dad.

82
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:35,640
Oh! Stan, could you just make a note to trademark "Angry Mother Goddess" and "Big Bad Creator Dad?"

83
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,059
Band name, game series, sandwich menu items; the possibilities are endless.

84
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:47,460
In the beginning of the Enuma Elish, the primordial freshwater, Apsû, and the primordial saltwater, Tiamat, "get together," if you catch my drift.

85
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:52,900
And produce the land, in the form of silt deposits Lahmu and Lahamu.

86
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:58,740
The land then got together, and created the first family of gods: Anshar, Kishar, and their son Anu

87
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:04,360
Who then created a second set of deities, lead by Ea, not to be confused with the Greek Eos, which means "dawn."

88
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,960
Ea and his brothers were a WILD bunch of crazy kids who disturbed their grandparents, Apsû and Tiamat.

89
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:15,480
Before Apsû could carry out his plan to force Ea and his brothers to "turn down their music and go to their rooms!"

90
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,640
Ea and Koh[?] killed Apsû. Which does seem a little extreme.

91
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:29,600
Unsurprisingly, Tiamat was... none too happy, so she created a bunch of snakes, dragons, fishmen, bullmen, and other horrors to teach those boys a lesson.

92
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:36,420
Ea, Anshar, and Anu went to war against the monsters, but were unable to defeat them without the help of Ea's son, Marduk

93
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:44,760
Now, Marduk, whom Ea called the Great Sun (with a U), was no dummy, and he saw his father's weakness as a chance to take over.

94
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:52,560
So he made a deal with Ea. Marduk would help defeat Tiamat if he could be named King of the Gods and, also, the Universe.

95
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:59,480
Ea agreed to Marduk's deal, and he went off to fight Tiamat, who, as sometimes happens, had transformed herself into a sea monster.

96
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,040
We made it! We made it to sea monsters.

97
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:08,000
Anyway, you probably know where this is going. Marduk defeated Tiamat, and became the king of the gods.

98
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But, hey, surprise ending: Marduk took Tiamat and divided her like a shellfish, to create the world.

99
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,520
Like weeding. And estate planning. Gods hate that stuff!

100
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:46,560
So, once again we see that a parent is divided up to create the physical world.

101
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:53,360
Often, this division is described as a sacrifice, and used to explain sacrifice rituals that we find in many religions

102
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:59,280
Now, are these myths just a way of justifying existing religious rituals, or is there something else going on here?

103
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:07,320
Maybe these myths have a psychological dimension too. They illustrate the willingness parents may have to sacrifice ANYTHING for their children.

104
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:13,640
But also, some of the messy, complicated, angry feelings that parents can feel towards their kids, and that kids can feel towards their parents.

105
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,180
Though, thankfully, that usually doesn't result in castration.

106
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:24,200
These myths show us that these feelings are as old as, and are even maybe the source of, creation itself.

107
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,060
Thanks for watching! We'll see you next week.

108
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:31,320
Crash Course Mythology is filmed in the Chad & Stacey Emigholz Studio in Indianapolis, IN

114
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,140
Hecatoncheiries!

115
00:11:54,140 --> 00:00:00,000
People say they're ugly, but they sure sound great.
