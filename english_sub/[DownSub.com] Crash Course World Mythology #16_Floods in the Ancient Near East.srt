00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
Hi, I'm Mike Rugnetta, this is Crash
Course Mythology,

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,800
and  we've spent a lot of this series on how various gods created the earth,

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,500
but now it's time to look at one way they destroy it.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,200
Today's topic..

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,500
is floods.

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,100
Oh!

7
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,200
Thoth put his swimtrunks on!

8
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,200
Thoth put his swimtrunks on! 
 All right, we're all ready, let's get started!

9
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:16,800
(water noise)

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,800
(Mike's wearing defective water wings)

11
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,000
*Egyption myth-trivia*

12
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,200
*Greek myth-trivia*

13
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,500
*Indian myth-trivia*

14
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,060
*Norse myth-trivia*

15
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,000
You're probably familiar with the story of the flood
from the Bible,

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,900
featuring Noah and the Ark, but

17
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,000
it turns out that alot of cultures have flood myths.

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,500
One explanation for this is the belief that
myths are rooted in history.

19
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,200
--remember Euhemerism?

20
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,200
Plus many of the earliest, complex societies grew around rivers--

21
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,800
--which would flood.
Most of the time, that flooding was neither predictable,

22
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,000
nor helpful; except for the
Nile river, whose floods were regular,

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,800
provided water for irrigation, and-

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,580
-were thought to be of divine significance.

25
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:58,700
Just ask Sobek, crocodile-headed god of
the Nile's floods.

26
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,100
Despite his frightening teeth, he also has a reputation for healing or protection in some stories.

27
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:08,100
-Anyway, flood myths may also reflect a
common theme in some of the myths we've examined:

28
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,400
The idea that creation's source..

29
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,100
..is PRIMORDIAL WATERS.

30
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,900
if water can bring life, it stands to reason,

31
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,000
it can also bring...

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
it can also bring...
DEATH.

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,100
You can see the symbolism in various purification
rituals like baptisms,

34
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:20,600
or

35
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,000
prenuptial cleansings.

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,800
They serve as tiny reenactments of floods

37
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,000
-where an old life is destroyed and a new life begins.

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,640
A tiny made-to-order single-serving flood:

39
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,720
adorable..

40
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,220
and destructive

41
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,000
Let's begin in ancient Mesopotamia
with one of our favorite mythical sources:

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,800
The Epic of Gilgamesh

43
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,200
Thought bubble?

44
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,000
What you got?

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
At the beginning of this particular story

46
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,500
the hero, Utnapishtim, is talking to Gilgamesh

47
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,770
about living in the city of Shurupakk
on the banks of the Euphrates.

48
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,000
He explains that a group of Gods,

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,500
Anu,

50
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,100
Anu, Enlil,

51
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,600
Anu, Enlil, Ninurta,

52
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,100
Anu, Enlil, Ninurta, Ennugi,

53
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,800
Anu, Enlil, Ninurta, Ennugi, and Ea

54
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,800
Anu, Enlil, Ninurta, Ennugi, and Ea
put their divine heads together..

55
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,400
..and decided to flood the place.

56
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,500
luckily for Utnapishtim, Ea has second thoughts,

57
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,229
and sneaks over to spill the beans.

58
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:03,600
Ea secretly tells Utnapishtim what's going down,

59
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,100
and orders him to leave his home,

60
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,300
all his possessions,

61
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,800
and to build a boat,

62
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,500
which will carry the seed of all living things.

63
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,800
Utnapishtim's boat is...

64
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,810
Utnapishtim's boat is... 
MASSIVE

65
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,500
--an acre in circumference, with six enormous decks.

66
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,100
Utnapishtim and his family loaded up with everything there was:

67
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,100
all the silver, gold, and seeds of every living thing;

68
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,680
his kith, and his kin and the
wild beasts, and all kinds of craftsmen--

69
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,500
--and also shuffleboard!

70
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,800
--and also shuffleboard and a killer buffet!

71
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,300
--and also shuffleboard and a killer buffet!
(I assume)

72
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,500
When the hour of destruction arrives,
the gods send down a terrifying storm.

73
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,200
So terrifying that even the gods were afraid of the flood-weapon.

74
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,200
and when they see what they've done to their creation,

75
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,000
the Gods,

76
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,800
the Gods, humbled,

77
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,400
the Gods, humbled,
sat there...

78
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,800
the Gods, humbled,
sat there... weeping.

79
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,600
(Whoops!)

80
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,000
The storm rages for seven days before
eventually blowing itself out.

81
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,950
Utnapishtim looks out of a porthole and sees
that all of mankind has been destroyed

82
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,500
--and he weeps.

83
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,200
He's just become the world's first cruise ship captain..

84
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,800
under VERY unfortunate circumstances.

85
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,900
His boat comes aground on mount Nimush,

86
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:04,900
and Utnapishtim sends out birds to search for dry land.

87
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,400
First,

88
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,100
First, 
a dove comes back,

89
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,800
First, 
a dove comes back, 
because there was no place to perch,

90
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,300
then,

91
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,200
then,
the swallow returns,

92
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,100
finally,

93
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,600
finally, 
he sends out a raven,

94
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,800
and when it doesn't return,

95
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
and when it doesn't return,
he knows dry land is out there...

96
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,100
somewhere.

97
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,100
He makes a sacrifice to the gods,

98
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,800
and am-scrays off that oat-bay, lickety-split.

99
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,800
Thank you, thought bubble!

100
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,300
So,

101
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,800
So, the flood destroys mankind,

102
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,500
So, the flood destroys mankind,
but..

103
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,200
..it doesn't end there.

104
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,900
..it doesn't end there.
Enlil, the brains behind the decision to destroy humanity,

105
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
sees that Utnapishtim and his family,

106
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,900
sees that Utnapishtim and his family, 
and also probably the craftsmen,

107
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,900
-have survived!
And he can't believe his eyes!

108
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,200
What sort of life survived?

109
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,500
What sort of life survived? 
No man should have lived through the destruction.

110
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,000
Ea, who had told Utnapishtim to build
the giant boat, chimes in:

111
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
"You are the sage of the gods, warrior,"

112
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
"so how,"

113
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
"so how, oh how"

114
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,200
"so how, oh how
could you fail to consult and impose the flood?"

115
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,200
"Punish the sinner for his sin,"

116
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,700
"Punish the sinner for his sin,
punish the criminal for his crime, but-"

117
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:01,200
"-ease off, let work not cease, be patient..."

118
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,500
Ea tries to instill some moderation in Enlil,

119
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,500
and suggests that maybe, in the
future, he could just send like

120
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,200
a lion,

121
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,000
a lion, 
or a wolf

122
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,100
a lion, 
or a wolf
or a plague..

123
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,100
you know, something mild...

124
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,000
you know, something mild... 
like a plague.

125
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Apparently this satisfies Enlil, because he shrugs,

126
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,668
pops on down to Utnapishtim's boat and

127
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:17,999
touches him on the forehead to make him

128
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
touches him on the forehead to make him
immortal.

129
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I guess it all works out in the end for Utnapishtim.

130
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,500
You know they say:
All's Well that Ends Well

131
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,200
-or doesn't end at all, ever,
because it's immortal.

132
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,910
So, this all probably sounds familiar to those of you
who know the flood story from the Bible.

133
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:33,200
I don't remember Noah having room for every piece of gold and silver alongside all those animals, but

134
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,200
both stories have angry divinities who order

135
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,200
a chosen person person to build a big boat, and fill it with wildlife.

136
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,800
Then, birds are sent to find land after the boat gets stuck on a mountain.

137
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,200
There are a number of important differences though, too.

138
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,000
First of all, the reason the Babylonian gods decided to destroy humanity is..

139
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,200
well, its unclear.

140
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,900
well, its unclear.
in one version it's because

141
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
humans are making too much noise which,

142
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,500
humans are making too much noise which,
okay,

143
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,000
humans are making too much noise which,
okay, fair,

144
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
humans are making too much noise which,
okay, fair, 
Keep it down you kids!

145
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Don't make me send a..

146
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,800
Don't make me send a.. 
deluge..

147
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,800
Don't make me send a.. 
deluge.. down there

148
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,100
Don't make me send a..
deluge.. down there and literally destroy you.

149
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,800
In the Old Testament the flood is punishment for mankind's sinfulness.

150
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,000
As the book tells it,

151
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,100
"God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the Earth,"

152
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,100
"and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart

153
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,800
"and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart
was only evil continually."

154
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:18,100
"And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the Earth,

155
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,100
"And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the Earth,
and it grieved him at his heart."

156
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,200
"And the Lord said,"

157
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:27,200
"I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the Earth;"

158
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,700
both man,

159
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,000
both man, and beast,

160
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,100
both man, and beast,
and creeping things,

161
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,500
and the fowls of the air,

162
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,000
for it repenteth me that I have made them.

163
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Which,

164
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,800
Which, I mean, man!

165
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,200
Which, I mean, man!
I don't LOVE the creeping things, but...

166
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,000
I don't want them DESTROYED,

167
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I don't want them DESTROYED, 
What about Anansi?

168
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,600
Yahweh commands Noah to build a boat,
like Ea did with Utnapishtim, but

169
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,800
Yahwah gives Noah even more detailed instructions.

170
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,000
He's also less efficient when it comes to the rainstorm.

171
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,800
It takes Yahweh 40 days to do what the Babylonian gods did in seven!

172
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,400
Then again, those Babylonians were working as a team.

173
00:05:59,489 --> 00:06:02,800
Like the Sumerian myth, Noah celebrates his survival with a sacrifice.

174
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,800
This seems to make Yahweh feel both relieved and...

175
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,500
sorry..

176
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,200
sorry.. for

177
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,000
sorry.. for destroying the world.

178
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:13,100
He says, "I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake;

179
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,800
for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth;

180
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,000
neither will I again smite anymore every living thing

181
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,100
neither will I again smite anymore every living thing
as I have done."

182
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,249
Whoops, again!

183
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:26,500
Yahweh doesn't make Noah immortal,
like Utnapishtim, but--

184
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,000
--he does promise Noah that he and his sons will
replenish the Earth,

185
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,800
and he gives them all the living things of the Earth for food,

186
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,500
along with some rules for how they should be eaten;

187
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,200
which,

188
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,200
which, I mean, that's got
to be pretty disappointing for those animals,

189
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,800
which, I mean, that's got
to be pretty disappointing for those animals, right?

190
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
Like, "YAY! We survived the floo-

191
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,949
Like, "YAY! We survived the floo-
you're gonne do WHAT?!?"

192
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:48,000
Most important, at least for this episode,
is that Yahweh establishes a covenant with Noah

193
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,689
and promises that he will never
have another flood destroy the Earth again.

194
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,000
Somewhere in-between the
inscrutable Babylonian flood,

195
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,900
Somewhere in-between the
inscrutable Babylonian flood,
and the sin-cleansing biblical flood,

196
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,000
is the Zoroastrian flood.

197
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,200
This is a myth that comes to us from ancient Iran.

198
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,200
It also features a lone survivor, named Yima,

199
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,000
who gathers two of each species to repopulate the Earth.

200
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
but, rather than building a boat,

201
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,100
Yima gathers the animals in his mountain-castle,

202
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,000
which is high enough to survive the rising floodwaters.

203
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,700
The creator God, Ahura Mazda, decides that the Earth needs a new beginning--not because of sin,

204
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:25,000
but because its
overwhelmed by the constant multiplication of its immortal beings.

205
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,100
This suggests that, prior to the flood,
Earth's inhabitants were immortal.

206
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:32,100
And it's only after this cleansing that we
have a world in which..

207
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,940
stuff dies.

208
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,800
In yet another flood myth, this one from Ovid's "Metamorphoses,"

209
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,000
Jupiter decides to destroy mortals for their sinfulness.

210
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,800
Jupiter seems to be worried that humans might contaminate other Earthly beings.

211
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,300
which,

212
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:45,900
which, I mean,

213
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,400
which, I mean, yeah,

214
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,000
Same!

215
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,200
The gods don't all agree with Jupiter,

216
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,200
but they assent to his decision because..

217
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,580
but they assent to his decision because.. 
he's the boss.

218
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,820
They're sad because they'll miss all the
delicious sacrifices that humans gave them,

219
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,200
but they agree that a flood is better than a fire,

220
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,000
because fires can get out of control,

221
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,900
and then reach up to Olympus.

222
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,100
Gods, only YOU can prevent heaven fires!

223
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,100
so Jupiter gets together with Neptune,

224
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,100
who pumps up the rivers, and whips up some high winds, and..

225
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,090
flood!

226
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,630
There's no chosen survivors for Jupiter,
he's trying to just wipe the slate clean.

227
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,800
But, luckily for Humanity, two people:

228
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,800
Deucalion

229
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,800
Deucalion and Pyrrha

230
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,100
Deucalion and Pyrrha
are fortunate enough to survive and so.. life carries on.

231
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,160
Jupiter obviously notices that these two

232
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,900
dodged his wrath but he's so impressed with Deucalion and Pyrrha's piety..

233
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,900
..that he spares them.

234
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,500
Like Utnapishtim and Noah, they give thanks in prayer,

235
00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:35,900
--and, like Noah, they're tasked with
repopulating the world.

236
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
They do that by throwing stones over their shoulders,
which become more humans.

237
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And that, kids,

238
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And that, kids,
is how babies are made!

239
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,900
And that, kids,
is how babies are made.
--no follow-up questions!

240
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,200
Today we learned that gods in the ancient Mediterranean world seemed...

241
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,500
...highly ambivalent about their creations,

242
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,200
--especially humans,

243
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,000
but ESPECIALLY creeping things.

244
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,300
But, also, there's enough similarity in these myths to suggest that..

245
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,300
..they may have influenced one another,

246
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,900
and that seems likely given the
amount of cultural transmission in the region.

247
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,130
And we also learned that a good
way to survive a flood is to be

248
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,900
reasonably righteous.

249
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,000
That helps Deucalion and Pyrrha, Noah and Yima but..

250
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,300
maybe the best way to survive the destruction of humanity

251
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,100
maybe the best way to survive the destruction of humanity
is to..

252
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,310
maybe the best way to survive the destruction of humanity
is to.. listen to the gods.

253
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:18,850
Especially when they give you detailed
instructions on how to build a boat.

254
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,100
Sometimes life, like a flood,
is unpredictable and frightening.

255
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,700
So..

256
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:27,000
It makes sense for us to look for meaning in tragedy wherever we can find it.

257
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,100
And one way we can find meaning is to tell a story..

258
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,500
..and then to change into some dry clothes.

259
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,000
Thanks for watching,

260
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
