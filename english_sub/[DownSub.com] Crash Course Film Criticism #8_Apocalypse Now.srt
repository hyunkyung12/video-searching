00:00:03,139 --> 00:00:06,210
There are war movies, and then there’s Apocalypse
Now.

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,690
In the late 1970s, Francis Ford Coppola hauled
a film crew into the jungles of the Philippines

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,910
and barely emerged with his sanity intact.

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,330
And, he emerged with a film that – after
two years of work in the editing room – is

5
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:21,429
as much about one soldier’s journey into
his own mind, as it is about the American

6
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:22,529
war in Vietnam.

7
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:26,589
It’s an ambitious film that, on its face,
shouldn’t work.

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,280
And yet it does, on so many levels.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:41,960
[Intro Music Plays]

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,800
Director Francis Ford Coppola was riding a

11
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:47,290
wave of success when he went off into the
jungle to make Apocalypse Now.

12
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:51,600
Over the previous seven years he’d made
three bona fide classics: The Godfather, The

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,670
Conversation, and The Godfather: Part II.

14
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,860
He’d proven he could tell intensely personal
stories with the scope and scale of myths.

15
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:04,160
His fascination with rituals, his daring camerawork,
and his ability to put viewers into the heads

16
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,530
of his characters had made him very successful.

17
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,500
Critically, commercially, and artistically.

18
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,340
As the 1970s drew to a close, the major Hollywood
studios were being gobbled up by multinational

19
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,340
corporations.

20
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,090
So executives were becoming more hesitant
to gamble on the personal, ambitious visions

21
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,271
of filmmakers like William Friedkin, Martin
Scorsese, and especially Francis Ford Coppola.

22
00:01:22,271 --> 00:01:26,649
Nevertheless, Coppola leveraged all the clout
he had, threw in a bunch of his own money,

23
00:01:26,649 --> 00:01:28,930
and headed off to the Philippines to make
his dream film.

24
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,899
He planned to use the Joseph Conrad novella
Heart of Darkness as the basis for a story

25
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:34,820
about the American war in Vietnam.

26
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,810
Conrad’s book follows its narrator Charles
Marlow up the Congo River in search of an

27
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,680
enigmatic ivory trader named Kurtz.

28
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,660
It’s the tale of Marlow’s growing obsession
with Kurtz, as well as a broader critique

29
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,549
of colonialism, and especially British imperialism.

30
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,770
In Apocalypse Now, an American Army captain
named Willard is dispatched by a shadowy group

31
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:57,320
of senior military officers (including Harrison Ford)to find a Colonel Kurtz and kill him.

32
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,009
Kurtz, we’re told, has gone insane.

33
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:02,240
He’s surrounded himself with an army of
Montagnard troops and fled

34
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,240
upriver into Cambodia.

35
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,210
When we first meet Willard, played by Martin
Sheen, he’s suffering some kind of post-traumatic

36
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,720
stress dream in a Saigon hotel.

37
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,610
It’s a stunning opening – dissolving from
a lush jungle ravaged by napalm, to thumping

38
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:17,010
military helicopters, to Willard’s violent
outbursts in the hotel – all scored to

39
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,120
“The End” by the Doors.

40
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,010
This reveals Willard’s damaged psyche, but
also what caused it: the horrors of war.

41
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,700
Then, Willard begins his journey upriver,
traveling on a Navy patrol boat manned by

42
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,700
a motley crew.

43
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,140
There’s the earnest captain known as Chief,
played by Albert Hall.

44
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,870
Sam Bottoms plays the California surf dude
Lance.

45
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,940
Chef, played by Frederic Forrest, is a saucier
from New Orleans who gets wound tighter as

46
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,940
the film continues.

47
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:51,319
And a baby-faced Lawrence Fishburne plays
Clean, the youngest member of the crew.

48
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:55,110
Together, these guys ferry Willard deeper
into Vietnam, encountering everything from

49
00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:00,330
a USO show starring Playboy Playmates to a
surf-loving, Wagner-playing Air Cavalry officer

50
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,120
played with gusto by Robert Duvall.

51
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,640
Killgore: If I say it's safe to surf this beach, Captain... It's safe to surf this beach!!!

52
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,500
The sights and sounds of their voyage grow
increasingly absurd.

53
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,750
And the ship’s crew becomes more unbalanced,
as they all look for ways to cope with the

54
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,000
madness of war.

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,360
When they finally reach Kurtz’s compound,
they discover macabre temples decorated with

56
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,750
hanging corpses, heads on spikes, and thousands
of silent Montagnard warriors in white paint.

57
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:30,480
With them is a manic American photojournalist
played by Dennis Hopper who warns Willard

58
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,520
that Kurtz has plans for him.

59
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,720
Photojournalist: He's got something in mind for you. Aren't you curious about that?

60
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,360
Kurtz himself, played by Marlon Brando, remains
an enigma right to the end.

61
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:46,099
Part warrior, part philosopher, and part tormented
soul, he’s mostly kept in shadows, looming

62
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:47,040
over Willard.

63
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,840
Kurtz: Are my methods unsound?

64
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:02,120
Willard: I don't see... any method... at all, sir.

65
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,480
Kurtz beheads Chef before he can call in an
airstrike, but keeps Willard alive, reading

66
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:10,970
him poetry and attempting to justify his actions
in whispered monologues.

67
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,299
Eventually, Willard decides to take action.

68
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:17,339
And as the Montagnards slaughter a water buffalo
in an elaborate ceremony, Willard uses the

69
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,269
same kind of machete to kill Kurtz.

70
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:23,190
Willard then emerges from the temple to face
the warriors, who kneel before him as he takes

71
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,680
Lance by the arm and pulls him back to the
boat.

72
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,420
THE END!

73
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,350
Now, the production of Apocalypse Now was
in serious trouble from the start.

74
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,060
Coppola was behind schedule and over budget
almost immediately.

75
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,690
He fired his lead actor within the first months
of filming.

76
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:40,110
And the replacement, Martin Sheen, was in
the midst of his own alcoholic breakdown

77
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,110
at the time.

78
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,790
Not to mention, he suffered a heart attack
in the middle of the shoot.

79
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:47,910
The crew, who was scrambling to keep up with
Coppola rewriting the movie as it was being

80
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,870
shot, returned to the hotel each night for
drug-fueled parties.

81
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:54,220
Much of the military hardware used in the
film, including the helicopters of the Air

82
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,300
Cavalry Unit, were on loan from the Filipino
military.

83
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,010
More than once, the real army needed them
back to fight their own war.

84
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,990
And partway through production, a typhoon
struck and wiped out nearly all of the sets

85
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:05,990
and equipment.

86
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,760
The stress of it all became so intense that
Coppola threatened to commit suicide more

87
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,400
than once and even suffered an epileptic seizure.

88
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,550
You know, just your average film shoot…

89
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,550
Except not.

90
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,550
It wasn’t.

91
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,550
Like, at all.

92
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:22,581
In the end, Coppola shot an unprecedented
one-and-a-half million feet of film, which

93
00:05:22,581 --> 00:05:24,820
comes out to about 240 hours of footage.

94
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:29,430
It took a team of four editors more than two
years of work to cut the film together, tear

95
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,280
it apart, and reconstruct it.

96
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,160
War journalist Michael Herr was brought in
to co-write Willard’s terse voice over after

97
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,680
test audiences couldn’t understand the story.

98
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,130
But, after all that, the film finally debuted
at the Cannes Film Festival – a year late

99
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,190
– and took home the top prize, the Palme
d’Or.

100
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:49,770
Apocalypse Now is a movie that emerged out
of a really complicated production process.

101
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,120
And it’s not a film that’s going to be
satisfied with a single interpretation.

102
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,390
One way to look at films is through the lens
of genre.

103
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:58,990
And the most obvious way to think about Apocalypse
Now is as a war movie.

104
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:01,530
But what if we look a little deeper?

105
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:05,400
American scholar B. Ruby Rich makes a compelling
case that Coppola’s film actually moves

106
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,660
through several different genres as it unfolds.

107
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,990
She sees the first part of the film as a western.

108
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:14,680
Willard is our silent, stoic white man, venturing
into the wilderness because so-called civilized

109
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,650
superiors don’t want to get their hands
dirty.

110
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:21,320
Rich writes, “There remaining no frontier
for today’s cowboys in the USA, men like

111
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,870
Kilgore must turn instead to Vietnam...

112
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:28,960
The eastern bankers and railroad tycoons of
yore become here military brass, those shrimp-eating

113
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,710
creatures far from [the] action.”

114
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,240
In place of Native American warriors fighting
to protect their homeland, the American soldiers

115
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,620
in Coppola’s film do battle with a largely
faceless North Vietnamese army.

116
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,620
The military fights with machine guns and
napalm, rather than rifles and small pox,

117
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:46,190
but the game plan is the same: slaughter the
dehumanized enemy and take their land.

118
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:50,490
This first part of the film even culminates
in an actual cavalry charge, led by Robert

119
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,680
Duvall’s Kilgore character in his ten-gallon
hat.

120
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,160
It’s even complete with a real life bugle
call.

121
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,470
Rich identifies the second section as a traditional
war film.

122
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:08,150
And it’s during this section that Willard
fires his only gunshot of the whole movie.

123
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:12,220
The patrol crew pulls over a passing Vietnamese
sampan, a flat-bottomed wooden boat.

124
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:17,040
In a tense stand off, Chief orders Chef to
board the boat to inspect its cargo.

125
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,040
Chef: There's nothing on it, man!
Chief: Get on it!

126
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,250
Chef: Alright!!!

127
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,880
Chef finds no contraband, but the stress of
the encounter starts to break him.

128
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,680
The confrontation escalates until a Vietnamese
woman rushes toward Chef.

129
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,220
Before it’s clear she’s only worried about
a puppy hidden in a basket, Clean opens fire.

130
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,970
The high-strung Americans spray the boat with
bullets, killing most of the Vietnamese crew,

131
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,520
and leaving the woman barely alive.

132
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,470
Chief orders her to be brought aboard and
sets a course for the nearest field hospital,

133
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:53,660
when Willard fires a single shot with his
pistol, killing her.

134
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,050
He shows no emotion other than annoyance.

135
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,050
His mission is Kurtz, and everything else
is a distraction.

136
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,580
Rich identifies this as a central turning
point for Willard’s character:

137
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:07,080
“Fed up with a code of honor that could
massacre a boat and then feed on its remorse,

138
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,650
Willard remarks [in voice over] that ... in
this moment … he has begun to feel close

139
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,610
to the mysterious Kurtz whose fate lies in
his hands.”

140
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:18,480
In this scene, Coppola also abandons the special
effects, the darkly funny absurdist touches,

141
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,280
and the rock-and-roll songs that play under
much of the action.

142
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,380
Instead, he presents war in direct, unsentimental
terms.

143
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,640
As senseless, barbaric, and arbitrary.

144
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,240
These soldiers aren’t portrayed as heroic,
like in some war movies.

145
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,820
Instead, they’re weary – losing hope,
mental stability, and, in many cases, their

146
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,820
lives.

147
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,100
But that’s just one way to view the film.

148
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:42,159
Seen through a psychoanalytic lens, Apocalypse
Now is the story of one man’s journey into

149
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,980
the depths of his own troubled mind, a mind
ravaged by war.

150
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:50,221
In this reading, the opening of the film dissolves
the boundaries between time and space, as

151
00:08:50,221 --> 00:08:52,320
seen from Willard’s damaged point of view.

152
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,260
As writer Maruerite Valentine puts it, “Willard’s
mind … has lost all capacity to differentiate

153
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:02,160
between the inside of his head, and the external
– the room, the hotel, Saigon.

154
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,890
Fantasy and reality have become one.”

155
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,130
The other characters Willard encounters on
his trip up the river, then, can be read as

156
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,850
reflections of himself.

157
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:12,900
The boat crew might represent other coping
strategies he’s tried while in the military,

158
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,840
while Kilgore could be a projection of his
war-loving feelings.

159
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,440
Even the commanding officers who send him
on the mission display the same calculated

160
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,590
dispassion that Willard shows through the
film.

161
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,320
Which means Kurtz could be a reflection of
Willard’s psyche too.

162
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,780
Kurtz is depicted in mostly darkness, as if
seeing him fully would be too much for Willard

163
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,780
to handle.

164
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:33,070
And he speaks in whispered, fragmented monologues
with unclear meanings.

165
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:38,240
In a way, he’s what Willard could – and
maybe does – become: pure ruthlessness,

166
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,200
entirely untroubled by morality.

167
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,630
This way of looking at a film is fairly common,
especially in the Slasher genre.

168
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,910
The prolific horror director Wes Craven once
posited,

169
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:50,680
“...I even think the characters that are
around the hero are elements of an uber personality.

170
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,630
And in this sense it’s like a Folk Tale
that says,

171
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,620
‘Okay, the part of you that’s going to
have sex when something really dangerous is

172
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,620
around?

173
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,620
That part is gonna be killed off…’”

174
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:02,020
Apocalypse Now’s ending has always divided
critics, some of whom believe the movie loses

175
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,290
its way in the last half hour.

176
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:07,230
But if we take this psychoanalytic reading
to its logical conclusion, the climax makes

177
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,230
sense.

178
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:11,910
When Willard gets to the end of his mission,
he recognizes himself in Kurtz, and he isn’t

179
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,440
sure he can go through with the kill.

180
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,610
That hesitance doesn’t make much sense in
a western, a war movie, or even a myth.

181
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,970
But if the story is of a man trying to root
out his worst impulses, to slay the dark,

182
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,910
powerful dragon in his own mind, the final
moments of the movie fit.

183
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:29,310
Because how do you destroy a piece of yourself,
however terrifying it might be?

184
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:33,950
As he’s dying, Kurtz utters his famous last
words.

185
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:42,280
Kurtz: The horror… the horror…

186
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,090
But maybe he’s not talking about the horrors
of Vietnam, or even his own death.

187
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:51,000
Instead, maybe he’s speaking as part of
a deeply troubled mind at war with itself,

188
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,030
fractured by his particular experience of
post traumatic stress.

189
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:57,870
Whether you choose to read Apocalypse Now
as an exercise in multi-genre filmmaking,

190
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:02,051
a journey into a damaged mind, or through
some other lens, one thing is clear: This

191
00:11:02,051 --> 00:11:04,280
is a film that invites multiple interpretations.

192
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:09,530
It’s a bold, messy masterpiece that nearly
broke its crew, star, and director.

193
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:13,760
And it remains as relevant today as it did
the day it was released...sadly.

194
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,060
Next time, we’ll trade the jungle of Vietnam
for the Spanish countryside as a little girl

195
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,220
unlocks a fantasy world that just might help
her escape the brutal aftermath of the Spanish

196
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,430
Civil War in Guillermo del Toro’s Pan’s
Labyrinth.

197
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:29,550
Crash Course Film Criticism is produced in
