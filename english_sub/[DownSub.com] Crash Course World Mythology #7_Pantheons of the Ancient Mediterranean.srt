00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,540
Hey there, I’m Mike Rugnetta and this is
Crashcourse Mythology and today we’re going

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,870
to start looking at pantheons.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:10,820
Pantheons are families of gods, and those
families are complicated.

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:11,820
Really complicated.

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,049
A whole tangle of grandparents and parents
and uncles and aunts and nieces and nephews

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:19,750
and a couple of children of mortal women who
were raped and a pretty staggering amount

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,679
of violence and incest to just round everything
off.

8
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:26,840
They have amazing feasts, but honestly, can
you imagine Thanksgiving with these people?

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,810
I mean Thoth, you had a mistress and a wife
and you somehow gave birth to yourself.

10
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:33,600
How is that not awkward?

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:43,780
INTRO

12
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,600
The pantheons we are going to examine are

13
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:50,079
families of deities from cultures that are
usually considered polytheistic, meaning that

14
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,949
they worshipped more than one god.

15
00:00:51,949 --> 00:00:56,040
In most mythological traditions, the gods
are seen as immortal, and according to David

16
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,399
Leeming, “they are personified projections
of the human mythmaker’s dreams of overcoming

17
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:06,040
the inevitable effects of the physical laws
that require death and disintegration.”

18
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,040
Yeah.

19
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,040
We went dark pretty quick.

20
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,090
In creation stories and other myths, gods
represent the creative force that brings and

21
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,130
sustains life.

22
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:17,960
In many myths, gods are “personifications
of aspects of nature and of human nature – the

23
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,420
sun, the winds, impatience, love.”

24
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:25,230
Pantheons, David Leeming argues, help us to
explain how and why the world we know came

25
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,320
into being, and can tell us a lot about a
culture.

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,170
Leeming writes:
“All pantheons are ontological and teleological;

27
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,829
that is they are metaphors for the human attempt
to make sense of existence itself and to assign

28
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:39,590
ultimate cause.

29
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:46,329
To “read” a pantheon is to read a culture’s
sense of itself and of the nature of the cosmos.”

30
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:49,020
But can pantheons explain the naked mole rat?

31
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,229
Let’s find out together.

32
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:52,490
If you thought that I was going to start with
the Greeks, ha!

33
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,490
Gotcha!

34
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,590
High five Thoth.

35
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,149
But we’re not starting with Egypt either.

36
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:57,149
Sorry.

37
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:00,560
We’re going to start with one of the oldest
pantheons we have records for, the family

38
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,530
of Gods from ancient Sumer in Mesopotamia.

39
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:09,500
Sumer’s pantheon represents the most important
natural forces in the lives of Ancient Mesopotamians,

40
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,270
and there are a lot of deities here, so strap
in.

41
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:18,950
Try to pay attention to everyone’s responsibilities,
and note what kinds of things don’t have

42
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:19,950
gods.

43
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:20,950
All right.

44
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:21,950
Here we go.

45
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,790
The first pair of deities are the earth goddess,
Ki, and the sky god, called An.

46
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:28,670
An mates with Ki, AND Nammu, goddess of primal
waters.

47
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:34,030
An and Nammu’s children are Enki, the trickster
god, and his sister, Ningikuga the goddess

48
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,030
of the reeds.

49
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:40,680
An and Ki, the more significant duo, begat
Ninlil, the air goddess, and Enlil the air

50
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,680
god.

51
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,090
Ninlil and Enlil give birth to Nanna, the
Moon God.

52
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,450
Enki and his sister Ningikuga create Ningal,
the Moon Goddess.

53
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,870
Ningal and Nanna then have three children.

54
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,340
Utu, the sun god, Inanna, the “Great Goddess
of Heaven and Earth”, and Ereshkigal, the

55
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,090
Queen of the Underworld.

56
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:02,120
Ereshkigal’s “husband” is Gugalanna,
the Bull of Heaven.

57
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,560
And Inanna marries the Shepherd Dumuzi.

58
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,120
Dumuzi, it turns out, was the son of Enki,
the trickster god, and his consort, the sheep

59
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,870
goddess Sirtur.

60
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:14,730
It may be worth nothing that yes: a sheep
goddess DID give birth to a shepherd.

61
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:21,590
So that is the basic pantheon of Sumer, but
what does all this tell us about Mesopotamia?

62
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,890
First it suggests that, at least in terms
of their myths, natural phenomena--like the

63
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:31,080
earth and sky--take precedence over human
actions and emotions--like love.

64
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,790
I mean, only two of the original Mesopotamian
gods, Enki the trickster and Inanna, also

65
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:42,120
the goddess of love, are described as ruling
over aspects of human nature.

66
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,120
And the sheep?

67
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,190
Well, we tend to think agriculture when we
talk about the Fertile Crescent, but the fact

68
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:52,650
that their pantheon features Sheep and a Bull
rather than a harvest deity might recall an

69
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,540
earlier life as herders.

70
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,680
Or perhaps the Bull is symbolic not only of
masculinity but also of farming.

71
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,420
This is the fun part of pantheons specifically
and mythology generally; you can read them

72
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,970
in many ways.

73
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,150
No, Thoth that’s not a joke about hieroglyphics.

74
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:13,721
And this leads us to our next, significantly
more complex family of gods, the Egyptian

75
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:14,721
pantheon.

76
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:18,070
Right off the bat I’m going to say that
the Egyptian pantheon is even more confusing

77
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,380
than your average confusing pantheon.

78
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,400
But surprise, surprise, it’s also just as
incestuous.

79
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,030
First off: There is no standard version of
the Egyptian pantheon.

80
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,450
the myth changes depending upon who is writing
it.

81
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,450
And where.

82
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,450
And when.

83
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:34,260
For example, in the story of Isis and Osiris,
our most complete source isn’t even Egyptian,

84
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:39,410
it’s the Greek biographer Plutarch, who
wrote in the first and second centuries CE,

85
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,700
well after Egypt had become Hellenized, and
then Romanized.

86
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:48,030
In his version of the Isis and Osiris myths,
he gives Egyptian gods Greek names.

87
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:51,910
For example, he refers to Thoth as Hermes,
he does still give you credit for inventing

88
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,160
darts, though, so.

89
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,860
There are also different versions of the pantheon
depending on where you are in Egypt.

90
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,770
For the most part we’ll be sticking with
the group of gods worshipped at the city of

91
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:06,320
Heliopolis and headed by Atum or Ra, but we’ll
give a nod to the fact that in Thebes the

92
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,920
pantheon was led by Amun.

93
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,290
And we can’t forget the attempted monotheism
of Akhenaton.

94
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,980
That was classic.

95
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:17,980
But just to make this even trickier, a lot
of the Egyptian sources we have for myths

96
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,540
are fragmentary and spread out over thousands
of years.

97
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:26,790
So, for simplicity, we’re going to settle
on the Nine-God pantheon that forms the core

98
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:30,860
of Egyptian religious belief, and it … doesn’t
include Thoth.

99
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,090
Sorry, buddy.

100
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:39,440
Anyway, the Ennead, or Nine Gods, was in place
in Heliopolis by 2700 BCE and is the one found

101
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,760
in the Pyramid Texts, which might be the oldest
surviving set of religious texts in the world.

102
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:51,750
At the top of this pantheon is Atum, aka Re
aka Ra, aka Khepri aka Amun or sometimes Amun-Ra,

103
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,270
depending on where in Egypt you are.

104
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,330
This is why we’re simplifying!

105
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,230
Atum is the great eye of the heavens and of
creation.

106
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:02,070
He was the spitter in our Egyptian creation
story.

107
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:07,880
So Atum’s creative cough creates Shu, the
life spirit, and Tefnut, the world order or

108
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,880
cosmos.

109
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,920
This brother and sister pair mate, and give
birth to Geb and Nut.

110
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,370
Geb is the spirit of life and Nut is an Egyptian
Great Mother goddess.

111
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:21,410
The two are separated by their father, Shu,
and Geb becomes Earth while Nut becomes the

112
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:27,300
sky and the stars, which is a neat reversal
of the whole earth mother sky father thing.

113
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,220
Like their parents, brother and sister Geb
and Nut become the mother and father of the

114
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,960
rest of the gods in this pantheon.

115
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,570
Their children, Osiris and Isis are probably
the best known Egyptian gods, other than hawk-headed

116
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:40,570
Ra.

117
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:45,420
Osiris, god of the underworld and grain, kind
of like a Demeter/Hades combo, was probably

118
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,750
the most popular of the Egyptian gods-because
who doesn’t like food and death?

119
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:54,370
He dies and is revived, which happens more
than you’d expect, in myth.

120
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:57,380
Actually, maybe just as much as you’d expect
in myth.

121
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,480
Isis is a goddess of the earth and the moon,
and is married to Osiris.

122
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,940
The mystery cult of Isis was popular well
beyond Egypt, into Roman times.

123
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,360
And if you’re not sure what a mystery cult,
guess what, that’s the point.

124
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,280
The second son and third child from the Geb-Nut
pairing is Seth.

125
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:19,010
Seth is a god of evil and darkness and is
the nemesis of Isis and Osiris.

126
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:23,780
He is married to his sister, Nephthys, a goddess
of death and dusk, because you know, if you’re

127
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,600
going to be married for all eternity, it’s
nice to share interests.

128
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,140
And the final piece of this puzzle is young
Horus, not to be confused with old Horus,

129
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,220
or the guy from WarHammer.

130
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:37,890
He was conceived miraculously by Isis and
Osiris after the latter’s death, and he

131
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,360
has aspects of a sun god.

132
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,720
He’s a light that defeats Seth’s darkness.

133
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,970
Most important though, Horus, who is often
depicted with the head of a falcon (not a

134
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:51,000
hawk, not an ibis) is the spiritual force
behind the pharaohs.

135
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,410
I know you’re wondering when we’re going
to talk about Anubis, Bastet, and Sekhmet,

136
00:07:55,410 --> 00:08:00,470
but remember, for the sake of comparative
simplicity, we’re sticking by this nine-god

137
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,470
pantheon.

138
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:04,970
So what conclusions can we draw from the basic
pantheon?

139
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:10,380
There are multiple versions of sun gods and
with Ra representing both the sun and creation,

140
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:16,500
and Horus representing both the sun and kingship,
we can infer that the sun was important to

141
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:22,010
the Egyptians, probably as much for its eternal
cycle of death and rebirth as for its providing

142
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,760
life-giving energy.

143
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,360
Ancient Egyptian culture is commonly said
to focus on death, and that’s not wrong,

144
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,929
although death to the Egyptians probably didn’t
hold the same terror that it does for many

145
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:33,929
in the modern world.

146
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:39,218
I think the most distinct example of this
necro-centric ideal is the pyramids, and the

147
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:44,470
mummified corpses and jars full of organs
found within them, but also this week’s

148
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:47,210
featured myth, the story of Isis and Osiris.

149
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,380
Take it away, Thoughtbubble.

150
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,760
Osiris was much beloved by the people of Egypt;
he showed them how to cultivate grain, gave

151
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,650
them laws, and taught them to honor the gods.

152
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:58,450
His brother, Seth, was envious, but wouldn’t
try anything while Osiris was away teaching

153
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,650
civilization to the world.

154
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:03,420
But when Osiris returned, Seth and seventy-two
accomplices had a plan.

155
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,180
A plan involving...furniture.

156
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,890
They had secretly measured Osiris’s body
and built a beautiful chest to his exact dimensions.

157
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:14,310
At a party celebrating Osiris’s return,
Seth suggested that whoever fit in the chest

158
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,940
would receive it as a gift.

159
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,839
Osiris gave it a shot, and when he lay down
in the box, the conspirators nailed it shut

160
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,310
and sealed it with lead.

161
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,820
They threw it in the river and, it floated
out to sea.

162
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,900
Isis, Osiris’s wife, went looking for
her husband, and found the chest near the

163
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:32,330
land of Byblos, where a great tree had grown
up around it, encasing the coffin in its trunk.

164
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:37,380
She cut away the wood around the coffin and
lay upon it, wailing with such grief and power

165
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:41,200
that the king’s younger sons died of fear.

166
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,180
Isis soon left the chest to visit Horus, and
Seth found the coffin while boar hunting.

167
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,040
He cut up Osiris’s body into 14 pieces,
and scattered them far and wide.

168
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,120
Isis, discovering what Seth had done, set
out to search for the pieces.

169
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,290
She found thirteen of them, but not what Izanami
might have described as “his excess.”

170
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:01,640
She buried the pieces where she found them,
which is why there are so many graves for

171
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,980
Osiris in Egypt.

172
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:07,570
Seth couldn’t find the true grave of Osiris,
and Osiris would be worshipped throughout

173
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,570
Egypt.

174
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,570
Win/Win.

175
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,529
Except for, the fact that he was dead.

176
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:12,529
Or WAS HE?

177
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:13,630
Thanks, Thoughtbubble.

178
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:18,720
This is one version of the story, but in another
version, upon finding the body of Osiris,

179
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,210
Isis and her sister Nephthys wept such a loud
lamentation that Ra the sun god took pity

180
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:30,290
on them and sent down Jackal-headed Anubis
to help Isis and Nephthys.

181
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:35,680
The two sisters, with the help of Anubis,
Thoth and Horus pieced Osiris back together

182
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,290
and wrapped him in linen bandages and performed
the funeral rites.

183
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:44,990
Isis flapped her wings over the body and Osiris
revived.

184
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:48,960
From then on he became the king of the dead,
ruling in the underworld.

185
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,630
So this myth illustrates some central facets

186
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,160
of Egyptian culture.

187
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,580
One is the idea of Osiris as king and god,
much like the pharaohs.

188
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:04,730
Another is the role of mummification in Egyptian
life., Or death., or well, actually: both.

189
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:10,300
The binding of Osiris and his revival is a
promise to Egyptians of eternal life.

190
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,130
According to David Leeming, Egyptians, “believed
that every man would live eternal in the other

191
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:19,839
world if only his surviving friends did for
his body what the gods had done for the body

192
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:25,900
of Osiris; … as Osiris died and rose again
from the dead, so all men hoped to rise like

193
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,900
him…”

194
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:31,310
This myth also suggests that in Egypt, the
pantheon is somewhat fluid, with gods performing

195
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,610
numerous roles.

196
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:36,680
Osiris goes from being the father of civilization
to the ruler of the underworld, a role that

197
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,330
in later Egyptian mythology will be taken
over by Anubis, while Seth is the source of

198
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:46,380
evil and trouble, the jealous younger brother
always trying -- and sometimes succeeding

199
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,900
– to take the place of his older brother.

200
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:54,320
We have a tendency to view pantheons as explanations
of natural phenomena that correspond between

201
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,390
particular gods and particular aspects of
nature, like the sun’s rising and setting.

202
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:03,899
But often the gods resist falling into such
restrictive roles.

203
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:08,690
And as myths like Isis and Osiris show, it’s
the particular stories that matter to people,

204
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,440
as much as if not more than who is the goddess
of what and why.

205
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,480
Just ask Saga, Norse goddess of storytelling. We're going to meet her really soon.

206
00:12:18,480 --> 00:00:00,000
But until then.  Thanks for watching. We'll see you next week.
