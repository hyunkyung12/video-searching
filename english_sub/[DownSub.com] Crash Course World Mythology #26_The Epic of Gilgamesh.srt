00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:04,019
Hi, I’m Mike Rugnetta this is Crashcourse
Mythology and today we’re returning to one

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,600
of the world’s favorite texts, The Epic
of Gilgamesh!

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,060
This is one of the oldest written stories
in the world. And it’s a great illustration

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:17,430
of Joseph Campbell’s monomythic hero’s
journey introduced last episode. Plus it has

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:28,310
sacred trees, lovestruck goddesses, and a
fearsome demon named Humbaba. To Sumeria!

6
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:36,319
INTRO
The Epic of Gilgamesh is more than four thousand

7
00:00:36,319 --> 00:00:42,879
years old. Written versions of the story date
back to 2100 BCE, which gives it incredible

8
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:48,670
historical value. For instance, several versions
of the Gilgamesh story use both Sumerian and

9
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:53,969
Akkadian names for gods, which shows -how
the story might have passed orally between

10
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:59,329
the cultures of ancient Mesopotamia. This
could also be considered syncretism – when

11
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:03,440
two religious traditions combine over time.
In this episode, we’re gonna work from a

12
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:10,210
version of the epic written around 1200 BCE,
and see how Gilgamesh himself fits into the

13
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:14,799
hero’s journey. A fair bit of warning though:
in this story, there is a brief mention of

14
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,020
rape.
At the start of our tale, Gilgamesh is the

15
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:24,350
king of Uruk, and he’s both a bad guy and
a bad king. His subjects are unhappy, he disrespects

16
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:29,280
the gods, and he’s a serial rapist. So,
basically he’s the opposite of a hero.

17
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,619
But Gilgamesh, like many “heroes” has
divine parentage – a goddess mom and human

18
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:41,200
king dad. Somehow this makes him two-thirds
god and one-third man? Try not to think too

19
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,640
hard about the math on that one. But either
way he’s still mortal, and that’s hard

20
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,249
for him to accept.
Eventually, Gilgamesh has a number of crazy

21
00:01:48,249 --> 00:01:53,030
adventures. He chops down some famous trees,
and meets his best friend Enkidu, who helps

22
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:58,160
Gilgamesh become a better man and a better
king. When Enkidu dies, Gilgamesh goes to

23
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,710
the underworld to try to bring him back. He
fails, however, and then must admit that he’s

24
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:08,830
human after all. In the end, Gilgamesh i s
considered a hero not just for his incredible

25
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:13,510
deeds, but for coming to understand and accept
his true nature.

26
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,760
But ok, let’s backtrack. Because along the
way, Gilgamesh manages to check off nearly

27
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,450
every single heroic scene that we learned
about in the last episode. We’re gonna count

28
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:27,330
‘em up, one by one. Play along from home!
Every time you see a heroic scene, shout it

29
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,720
out. But ugh, I’m pretty far away, so just
make sure that you shout, like, really…

30
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,730
REALLY loudly.
So! Things get started in the Epic when Gilgamesh

31
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:40,310
and Enkidu first meet. Right away they decide
to wrestle each other, and realizing that

32
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,760
they’re evenly matched, they reach a stalemate.
This is a heroic trope in its own right (just

33
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,200
not one of Campbell’s); think Robin Hood
and Little John, Arthur and Lancelot, or Vin

34
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,340
Diesel and
Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson in Fast Five.

35
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:57,020
After dusting themselves off and becoming
bffs, Gilgamesh and Enkidu return to Uruk

36
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:02,530
to do kingly stuff. But Enkidu–who’s used
to living in the wilderness–he gets bored.

37
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:08,140
Gilgamesh proposes they head to the forest
and face off against a terrifying demon adversary:

38
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:13,660
Humbaba. Yeah, it’s just, it’s not a very
threatening name, I know. But trust me, he’s

39
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,830
a big deal, very terrifying. But did you see
what happened? This is what Campbell would

40
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,870
call the Announcement of the Quest (1).
To prep for the journey, Gilgamesh and Enkidu

41
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:27,560
get Supernatural Aid (2) in the form of some
special weaponry. Then they have a quick Refusal

42
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,390
of the Quest (3) as Enkidu, who knows the
power of Humbaba, tries to warn Gilgamesh:

43
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:39,070
“Humbaba, whose shout is the flood weapon,
whose utterance is Fire and whose breath is

44
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:46,060
Death, can hear for a distance of sixty leagues
through the forest, so who can penetrate his

45
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:51,090
forest? Debility would seize anyone who penetrated
his forest.”

46
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:56,690
But Gilgamesh persists. Gilgamesh and Enkidu
meet the Goddess (4), Gilgamesh’s mom Ninsun.

47
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:01,800
She’s not particularly happy with her son’s
plan, but she blesses Gilgamesh and adopts

48
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:08,000
Enkidu. In the forest Enkidu warns Gilgamesh
about its gates saying how afraid he is to

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,360
Cross the Threshold (5). But once again, Gilgamesh
persists, and the two venture forth into the

50
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,779
darkness of the forest...now deep in the Belly
of the Whale (6).

51
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:20,439
And we’re going to follow them right in.
Thoughtbubble, take us in there. Creeping

52
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:26,030
through the pine forest, Enkidu and Gilgamesh
prepare to confront Humbaba. Before long,

53
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:33,400
the earth shakes and the sky goes dark. Humbaba
is upon them! Humbaba is massive, with the

54
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,720
face of a lion, or scales, or vulture feet,
or a snake tail – depending on which version

55
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,020
you read...but, nonetheless, very fearsome!
Undeterred, Gilgamesh and Enkidu leap into

56
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:49,750
battle. With Supernatural Aid (7) from the
god Shamash, and some divine winds that bind

57
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,620
Humbaba, Gilgamesh slays the demon and removes
its head.

58
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,170
If you’re keeping score at home, this step
is technically “Atonement with the Father

59
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:03,940
(8)”. Humbaba can be read as a terrible,
overbearing Father figure that must be, well,

60
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:09,430
not so much atoned with as, you know, beheaded.
After the glorious battle, Gilgamesh and Enkidu

61
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:15,260
fell a bunch of sacred trees, build a raft,
and sail home with Humbaba’s noggin. Once

62
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:21,120
home, Gilgamesh takes a bath and puts on some
royal robes in anticipation of his Meeting

63
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,540
with a Goddess (9). In this case, the goddess
is Ishtar, who definitely has a thing for

64
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:34,340
Gilgamesh. She says: “Come to me Gilgamesh
and be my lover! Bestow upon me the gift of

65
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,730
your fruit! You can be my husband, and I can
be your wife.”

66
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:43,090
Gilgamesh refuses Ishtar’s advances, though
– maybe he just wasn’t ready to share

67
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:48,400
his fruit – which makes this scene Woman
as Temptress (10). Insulted, Ishtar sends

68
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:55,651
the Bull of Heaven to kill Gilgamesh, who
with Enkidu, kills the bull. But Enkidu, who

69
00:05:55,651 --> 00:06:03,220
just does not know when to quit, slaps Ishtar
with a chunk of said bull. Not. Smart. Friendo.

70
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:09,810
And with that beefy slap, Enkidu seals his
fate. The life drains from his body, he gets

71
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:14,440
sicker and sicker and ... dies.
Thank you Thoughtbubble. With Enkidu dead,

72
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,711
Gilgamesh is at a turning point. He thought
he’d finished his hero’s journey! After

73
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:24,380
travelling to the ends of the earth, defeating
his “dad”, and returning home with a gross

74
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:30,100
bloody trophy… HE PUT ON ROBES! He was DONE!
But now, with the loss of his best friend,

75
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:36,690
Gilgamesh feels yet another call to adventure.
So, he leaves Uruk to roam the country, wondering:

76
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:44,991
“Shall I die too? Am I not like Enkidu?
Grief has entered my innermost being. I am

77
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:52,440
afraid of Death and so I roam open country.”
Gilgamesh is on another heroic quest, this

78
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:58,680
time to overcome death and live eternally.
He resolves to find Utnapishtim, who you might

79
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,720
remember from a previous episode – he’s
the dude who was granted immortality after

80
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,470
surviving the great flood. Along the way,
Gilgamesh crosses the mountains that guard

81
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:11,950
the rising and setting sun and confronts monstrous
Scorpion men.

82
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:16,380
Crossing the mountains means another Crossing
the Threshold (11) and crossing this threshold

83
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:23,650
means Gilgamesh is in the Belly of yet another
Whale, walking through ten leagues of darkness.

84
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:28,270
Eventually, stumbling through the dark, Gilgamesh
has another Meeting with the Goddess. This

85
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:33,410
time it’s Siduri, the goddess of beer and
wisdom, two things that don’t often go together.

86
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:38,910
Siduri tells Gilgamesh that to meet Utnapishtim,
Gilgamesh must cross lethal waters with the

87
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:45,330
boatman Ur-shanabi. Gilgamesh thanks Siduri
for the beer, sets off, and finds Ur-shanabi.

88
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:50,669
Immediately, Gilgamesh bashes Ur-shanabi over
the head. Which just, that seems very, very

89
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:56,410
rude – I mean, why would Gilgamesh treat
Ur-shanabi so Ur-shabbily? [beat] Anyways,

90
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:00,620
I suppose maybe clobbering is the only way
that Gilgamesh know how to communicate with

91
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,810
people who aren’t goddesses.
In addition to bashing Ur-shanabi over the

92
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:08,510
head, Gilgamesh smashes all of the “things
of stone.” Which is unfortunate because

93
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:12,270
it turns out that those “things of stone”
are the tools Ur-shanabi needs to cross the

94
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:18,890
water. So Gilgamesh has yet another task – he
must cut down trees to make punting poles.

95
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:23,800
Finally, Ur-shanabi shows Gilgamesh how to
use the poles to cross the lethal waters and

96
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:31,250
reach Utnapishtim. But when he does Gilgamesh
can’t exactly celebrate. Utnapishtim challenges

97
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:35,229
him. He asks:
“Why have you exerted yourself? What have

98
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:40,649
you achieved?
You have made yourself weary for lack of sleep,

99
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:45,430
You only fill your flesh with grief,
You only bring the distant days of reckoning

100
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:50,499
closer.
Mankind’s fame is cut down like reeds in

101
00:08:50,499 --> 00:08:54,230
a reed-bed
Nobody sees the face of Death

102
00:08:54,230 --> 00:09:01,959
Nobody hears the voice of Death.
Savage Death just cuts mankind down.”

103
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:09,420
This isn’t...exactly... the the answer Gilgamesh
was hoping for. Is Utnapishtim going to turn

104
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:15,790
him away? Is he doomed to remain mortal? Gilgamesh
persists, so Utnapishtim tells him his own

105
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:21,100
story – about the flood, being chosen by
Ea, the gods granting him immortality. And

106
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:26,750
this is a revelation to Gilgamesh, the truth
of immortality, and it serves as his Apotheosis

107
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,540
(12).
Utnapishtim decides if Gilgamesh really wants

108
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:35,300
to be immortal – fine. But to prove his
worth, he has to complete a Road of Trials

109
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:41,070
(13) with just one, simple task. Gilgamesh
must stay awake for six days and seven nights.

110
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:47,529
No problem, Gilgamesh says. Easy, he snorts.
He plops down on a rock and–having walked

111
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:50,759
in the darkness for over ten leagues–instantly
falls asleep. Whoops!

112
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:57,319
Even though Gilgamesh failed his test, Utnapishtim
gives him an out. If he really wants to avoid

113
00:09:57,319 --> 00:10:03,040
death there’s a secret plant, a root like
a camel-thorn. If he can track it down, it’ll

114
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,790
bring him great rejuvenation. This will be
his Ultimate Boon (14).

115
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:13,029
So does Gilgamesh get his magic plant? Yes
and no. He manages to find it growing deep

116
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:17,759
underwater, and by tying stones to his feet,
manages to sink down, snip a sample, and float

117
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:22,910
back up to the surface. After this, he sets
off for his Great Return (15) to civilization.

118
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:28,679
But. After all that. On his way home, Boon
in hand...Gilgamesh decides that he should

119
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:35,800
stop and take a bath. While he’s soaking,
a snake slithers up, sneaks behind him, curls

120
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:42,470
around the plant and disappears. As he towels
himself off, he sees the plant is gone and

121
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:51,990
is just... defeated. He sits down and weeps.
Gilgamesh must return home empty handed.

122
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:59,420
So - what is heroism? Gilgamesh is a mighty
warrior who stands up to terrible monsters

123
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:04,879
and discovers the secret of immortality, but
who ultimately fails in his quest. Over the

124
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:09,670
course of the story he has almost all the
experiences set forth in Campbell’s monomyth,

125
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:14,860
sometimes more than once. But is this what
makes him a hero?

126
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:19,220
Really, Gilgamesh is kind of an ambivalent
figure. His journey has many successes, but

127
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:24,309
also many failures. His bravery – or lack
of respect – allows him to challenge and

128
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:30,139
kill Humbaba, but also gets Enkidu killed.
He proudly announces that he’s up to Utnapishtim’s

129
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:35,000
challenge, but he simply isn’t. At the end
of the epic, Gilgamesh comes to terms with

130
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,600
his limitations as a human. This completes
the journey, achieving the final, crucial

131
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:48,389
step – having the power and wisdom to live
a good life. Not an eternal life, but a good

132
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:54,579
one. In Gilgamesh’s case, that means one
where you aren’t a terrible king. Eva Thury

133
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:57,759
and Margaret Devinney sum up Gilgamesh’s
heroism pretty well:

134
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:02,749
“Gilgamesh wants to escape human limitations,
to get answers to questions not available

135
00:12:02,749 --> 00:12:09,279
to his contemporaries, and perhaps most importantly,
he wants to overcome mortality both for himself

136
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,890
and others. But ultimately his story shows
us that, despite his extraordinary talents,

137
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:20,899
in these matters he is not different from
other humans. Thus, we see that it is precisely

138
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:25,129
his human limitations that make him truly
heroic.”

139
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:33,149
So, is he perfect? No. Is he even a role model?
Definitely not. But can he serve as a symbol

140
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:41,420
for an aspect of the human condition, of growing
past mistakes and accepting limitations? Maybe.

141
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:46,959
And perhaps THAT is what makes him a “hero”.
Next week we’ll see just how many heroes

142
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,829
might be lurking where you’re not expecting
them. Oh! And also, we’re gonna talk about

143
00:12:50,829 --> 00:13:34,989
an army of flying monkeys that I may or may
not call “my pretties”. Thanks 

144
00:13:34,989 --> 00:00:00,000
for watching. We’ll see you soon!
