1
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,060
To film school, or not to film school?

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,060
That is the question.

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,280
Or it might be, if you’re interested in
becoming a filmmaker.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,650
And it doesn’t have an easy answer.

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,579
Some filmmakers, like Francis Ford Coppola,
Martin Scorsese, and George Lucas, attended

6
00:00:14,579 --> 00:00:16,990
film school and have thrived making feature
films.

7
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,010
On the other hand, James Cameron and Steven
Soderbergh have both won Academy Awards for

8
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,990
Best Director without ever attending a single
class.

9
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,539
Everyone’s experience is going to be different,
but there are some things that you can generally

10
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,300
expect to get from going to film school.

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,010
And with some careful consideration, you might
be able to chart a course that’s right for

12
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,360
you and emerge as the next big thing.

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:48,060
[Opening Music Plays]

14
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,220
The world’s first film school was founded in 1919.

15
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,920
As with many early film schools, the focus
at the Moscow Film School was on studying

16
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,199
films that already existed, rather than actually
making movies.

17
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,650
The theories developed by the students and
teachers in Moscow eventually gave birth to

18
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:05,170
the Soviet Montage film movement
and movies like Battleship Potemkin and Man

19
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,910
with a Movie Camera.

20
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,280
In 1929, the University of Southern California’s
School of Cinema Arts was founded by early

21
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,900
cinema big-shots like Mary Pickford, Ernst
Lubitsch, and D.W. Griffith.

22
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,320
USC has maintained that close connection to
Hollywood right up to the present day, counting

23
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,180
George Lucas, Judd Apatow, and Star Wars:
Episode 8 director Rian Johnson among its alumni.

24
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:28,420
And in 1965, two major film schools were founded
in New York City: one at New York University’s

25
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,900
Tisch School of the Arts, and the other as
part of Columbia University’s School of

26
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,900
the Arts.

27
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,240
Although younger than the Southern California
schools, NYU and Columbia have caught up in

28
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,190
terms of the success of their graduates.

29
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:42,479
Spike Lee, Martin Scorsese, and Brokeback
Mountain director Ang Lee all went to NYU,

30
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,960
while Columbia boasts Hurt Locker director
Kathryn Bigelow, James Mangold who made 3:10

31
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,060
to Yuma and Logan, and Jennifer Lee, the writer
and co-director of a little movie called Frozen.

32
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,240
These days, there are film schools in almost
every state in the United States, as well

33
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,860
as in many other countries around the world.

34
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,680
You can find them in big international cities
like Paris, London, and Beijing, to smaller

35
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,509
places like Austin, Texas; Mahwah, New Jersey;
and Anchorage, Alaska.

36
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:09,119
Some are well known, like the programs at
CalArts, the American Film Institute or AFI,

37
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,580
or the University of California Los Angeles,
better known as UCLA.

38
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,750
Others are hidden gems, like Emerson College
in Boston or Denver’s Colorado Film School.

39
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,580
The point is: if you decide that film school
is right for you, you have options, no matter

40
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,580
where you live.

41
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,100
So what will you learn if you go?

42
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,320
Film schools can be undergraduate or graduate
programs at universities, colleges, and community

43
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,320
colleges.

44
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,820
They might be free standing degrees at those
schools, or they might be housed in other

45
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,800
departments, like English, Fine Arts, Theater,
Media Studies, or Communications.

46
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,370
Most film schools will teach you to both study
and make films.

47
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,730
Education isn’t necessarily just about practicing
a trade.

48
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,170
It can also be about exposing yourself to
other ways of thinking, writing, creating,

49
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,170
or watching.

50
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,260
In other words, it can be a time for experimentation!

51
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,421
Classes on film history, theory, and criticism
will introduce you to films, filmmakers, film

52
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,310
movements, and various ways to think critically
about them.

53
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:57,670
While courses on things like screenwriting,
cinematography, directing, and editing will

54
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:01,060
give you the skills and experience you’ll
need to produce your own films.

55
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,130
These same subjects are taught in many film
schools, but teaching methods can differ.

56
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,980
Most schools follow either the conservatory
or liberal arts approach.

57
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,930
Conservatory schools, like the American Film
Institute, the New York Film Academy, and

58
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:17,910
to some extent NYU, focus on educating world-class
artists and technicians devoted to a single

59
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,370
field within filmmaking.

60
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:23,270
Very early on at a conservatory school, you’ll
choose a “track” with help from faculty

61
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,400
and advisors, and you’ll study that subject
almost exclusively.

62
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,540
You might decide to become an editor, a cinematographer,
a director, or a sound designer, and your

63
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,980
classes and exercises will be geared toward
the craft, art, and technology of that particular role.

64
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,120
As a result, conservatory schools tend to
turn out graduates who excel at their particular

65
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,850
job and know it inside and out.

66
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:44,420
If you’re looking for a broader understanding
of cinema and its place in the world, or you

67
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,160
don’t yet know which track you want to pursue,
a liberal arts-based film school might be

68
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,160
a better fit.

69
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,180
In practice, liberal arts film schools offer
students the chance to try a variety of filmmaking

70
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,790
roles, and gain a deeper understanding of
the whole filmmaking process, rather than

71
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,380
just one specific part of it.

72
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,840
And while students will still learn how to
line up a shot or make a rough cut, they’ll

73
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,880
also be encouraged to think about cinema in
its larger cultural, economic, historical,

74
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,120
and political contexts.

75
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,570
Of course, you’ll also find film schools
that split the difference between these two

76
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:14,150
approaches, providing a broad liberal arts
education for initial courses, and pivoting

77
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,529
to a more track-based curriculum for the later
ones.

78
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:18,039
So what does film school really get you?

79
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,540
First and foremost: time.

80
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,900
School gives you the time to focus on the
craft of filmmaking in a structured environment.

81
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,290
Time to fail, learn from your mistakes, and
try again.

82
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:29,970
And time to experiment and find your artistic
voice, while you’re given critical feedback

83
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,980
from teachers and your fellow students.

84
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,060
Depending on where you go, film school might
also let you move closer to a filmmaking hub,

85
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,730
be it New York, Los Angeles, or even Chicago,
Atlanta, or Austin.

86
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:43,540
Just being close to the action can be a powerful
motivator for aspiring filmmakers.

87
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,870
In terms of technology, many film schools
give you the opportunity to get your hands

88
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,030
on a lot of the equipment you’ll find on
sets – like jibs, dollies, cameras, or microphones

89
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,650
– while an expert helps guide you.

90
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,180
And you’ll learn to collaborate!

91
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,190
Film is an intensely collaborative industry
and medium, and being forced to rely on and

92
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,480
work with your peers is a big part of the
film school experience.

93
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,590
Even more importantly, film school gives you
access to a community of people who are just

94
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:08,010
as obsessed with films and filmmaking as you
are!

95
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:12,691
That network of teachers, mentors, and trusted
peers will become your allies as you all develop

96
00:05:12,691 --> 00:05:16,020
your creative projects and find opportunities
to work in the film industry.

97
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:20,520
Many film school graduates think of this community
as one of the biggest benefits of their formal education.

98
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,520
And, of course, you’ll earn a degree.

99
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,700
A degree can have value as a symbol of your
passion, commitment, and follow-through, but,

100
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,150
sadly, it doesn’t guarantee you a job or
a career.

101
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,770
And that leads us into some arguments against
attending film school.

102
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,770
It’s expensive.

103
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,700
Not only will you pay tuition, but you’ll
have to fund your own films.

104
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,800
And don’t forget, you might have to move
to a bigger, pricier city to pursue your dreams.

105
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,750
Not to mention, film is an exceptionally competitive
industry that often depends on who you know

106
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,650
and how good you are at your job.

107
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:49,750
There’s a lot of luck and timing mixed in
with the tenacity, hard work, and talent required

108
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,750
to succeed.

109
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,460
Also, your learning style might not be suited
to a classroom.

110
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,480
Some people thrive in an academic environment,
while others do better with a hands-on approach

111
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,660
or more unstructured exploration.

112
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,420
If that’s you, film school might not be
the best option.

113
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,830
But if you decide film school is too expensive
or not a good fit, there are a number of other

114
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,860
paths you can take to become a professional
filmmaker.

115
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,139
Many directors started out working as crew
members on other people’s films before making

116
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:13,139
movies of their own.

117
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,570
Alfred Hitchcock began as a title designer,
and worked his way up to directing classics

118
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,370
like Psycho and Rear Window.

119
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:22,870
Before dreaming up The Terminator, Aliens,
Titanic, and Avatar, James Cameron got his

120
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:26,380
start as a set painter for famous B-movie
producer Roger Corman.

121
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:30,580
Cameron reportedly mastered so many different
skills that, today, his crew members talk

122
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:35,050
about upping their game because he can probably
do their job at least as well as they can.

123
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:38,700
This kind of apprenticeship approach was even
built into the structure of some international

124
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,750
film industries until fairly recently.

125
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,670
Up until at least the 1980s in England, for
example, most directors were obligated to

126
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,330
put in their time as an Assistant Director
before they were given the chance to make

127
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,330
their own films.

128
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:53,180
In the 1990s, though, A-list directors like
Quentin Tarantino and Steven Soderbergh took

129
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,770
an entirely different path.

130
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,610
Instead of apprenticing for other filmmakers,
they both studied hundreds if not thousands

131
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:02,870
of films on their own, with a focus and intensity
most film students couldn’t muster.

132
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:07,780
Their feature film debuts – Reservoir Dogs
and sex, lies, and videotape – both display

133
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:12,870
an incredible grasp of storytelling, film
grammar, and tone, at a level remarkable for

134
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,080
self-taught directors.

135
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,270
Paul Thomas Anderson, acclaimed director of
Boogie Nights and There Will Be Blood, split

136
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,300
the difference.

137
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,280
He was an intense student of film long before
he got to film school… and then dropped

138
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,500
out after the first day!

139
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,550
The proliferation of things like Blu-ray special
features and online tutorials make this kind

140
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,140
of DIY approach more possible than ever before.

141
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:33,590
“Lessons from the Screenplay” on YouTube
and the website and podcast ScriptNotes are

142
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,560
great resources for screenwriters.

143
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,470
While sites like Cinematography.com can teach
you tips and tricks about cameras, lighting,

144
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,470
and special effects.

145
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:44,090
In fact, the falling cost of film equipment
and the ability to distribute your work on

146
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:48,180
the Internet has done more to change the film
school equation in the last decade than anything else.

147
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,680
You can build online communities and peer
groups of like-minded filmmakers from around

148
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,590
the world, which might make film school less
necessary.

149
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,690
And it’s not like Warner Brothers is gonna
turn you down for a directing job because

150
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,580
they find out you don’t have a degree!

151
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,580
Think about it this way.

152
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,050
If you want to become a doctor, you need to
go to medical school, right?

153
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,490
If you can afford it and your grades are good
enough, you’ll graduate and – boom – you’re

154
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,490
a doctor.

155
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,669
It doesn’t guarantee you a job, but it does
mean you’re very likely to find work in

156
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:11,669
the medical field.

157
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:13,419
It’s also the only way to become a doctor.

158
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:17,199
For filmmakers, film school is just one
of many paths you might take.

159
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,930
That’s the great advantage and drawback
to pursuing a career in film: you can get

160
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,560
there any number of ways… but none of them
are guaranteed.

161
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,350
So, is film school the right choice for you?

162
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,610
I can’t tell you that.

163
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,870
But luckily, the person who can tell you
is watching this video right now.

164
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,510
...It’s you, I’m talking about you.

165
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:35,150
Take some time and think about the environments
in which you learn best, the communities you

166
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,929
could build and be a part of, and what you
can afford.

167
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:41,759
And remember: whatever form your education
takes, it’s the work you do, and the kind

168
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,990
of collaborator you become, that matter most.

169
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,040
Today we talked about the history of film
school and the different approaches they take

170
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,520
to educating filmmakers.

171
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,900
We discussed the benefits of film school,
from access to equipment, peer groups, and

172
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,270
mentors to the time to make mistakes.

173
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:58,330
And we looked at other options, from apprenticeships
to self-education and building your own community

174
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,740
of collaborators online.

175
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,200
Next time, we’ll focus our attention on
the history and exciting current state of

176
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,480
television production.

177
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,140
Crash Course Film Production is produced in
association with PBS Digital Studios.

178
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,080

180
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,370
