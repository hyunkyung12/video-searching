1
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,210
What’s playing at the multiplex today?

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,420
Another big-budget sequel?

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,000
The same old romantic comedy?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,620
Yet another superhero movie? ...probably that last one.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,580
A lot of the time, Hollywood is driven by
trends.

6
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,940
The success of one film or genre inspires
others to jump on the bandwagon.

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,750
And that’s how we end up with nothing but
reboots and dystopian fantasies.

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,970
The same thing happened after World War II.

9
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,930
Audiences around the globe were getting tired
of the films coming out of Hollywood… calling

10
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,410
them artificial, self-important, and inauthentic.

11
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,460
From the Italians in the 1940s to the French
in the 1960s, and even independent directors

12
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,140
at work today, filmmakers have found ways
to challenge the classical Hollywood model

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,390
by creating their own vibrant and original
films.

14
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:42,740
So let’s talk about Italian Neo-Realism,
the French New Wave, and all kinds of independent cinema.

15
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,460
Are we going to talk about Sharknado?
Nick: No.
Craig: Okay good!

16
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:59,480
[Opening Music Plays]

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,560
Between the 1930s and 1950s, the major American

18
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,180
film studios perfected a particular style
of filmmaking we call classical Hollywood cinema.

19
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,700
Their stories were chaste, formulaic, and
mostly upbeat.

20
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,670
The good guys almost always won, and husbands
and wives couldn’t even share a bed.

21
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,740
Many of the films were shot on constructed
sets or the studio’s backlot.

22
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,319
And most used a flat, generic form of lighting
called high key lighting that ensured the

23
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:21,909
entire image was clearly visible.

24
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:25,060
A lot of great films came out of the studio
system, but Hollywood was churning out between

25
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,479
six- and eight-hundred films a year and dominating
the global film market.

26
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,639
By the mid-1940s, audiences were ready for
something new.

27
00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:34,849
The first post-World War II movement to find
its voice was Italian Neo-Realism.

28
00:01:34,849 --> 00:01:38,740
Many of its filmmakers, like Roberto Rossellini
and Vittorio de Sica, were working directors

29
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,840
before the war and started shooting again
as soon as the fighting ended.

30
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,039
After living through that violent time, they
craved a more raw and authentic style than

31
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:47,200
classical Hollywood cinema could provide.

32
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,989
Filmmaking tools for these guys ran thin:
Cinecittà, the film studio in Rome, was nearly

33
00:01:50,989 --> 00:01:54,710
destroyed during the war, equipment was often
damaged or missing, and film stock was hard

34
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,710
to come by.

35
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,069
But these resourceful Italian filmmakers found
a way to turn these disadvantages into a style

36
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:01,409
that reflected the harsh reality they saw
around them.

37
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:06,700
The first Italian Neo-Realist film was Roberto
Rossellini’s 1945 masterpiece Rome: Open City.

38
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,699
Set and shot in the Italian capital just after
the end of the war, the film tells the tragic

39
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:13,570
story of a handful of characters living under
Nazi occupation.

40
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,990
Rossellini mixed non-actors with movie stars
and filmed in and around buildings that had

41
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:17,990
actually been bombed.

42
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:21,689
The film has an extremely rough look, a plot
that meanders from character to character,

43
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:24,209
unexpected and shocking deaths, and an ambiguous
ending.

44
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:27,360
Nothing about it screams “classical Hollywood,” and that’s what helped turned it into a hit.

45
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,520
Other Italian Neo-Realists followed Rossellini’s
example, focusing on stories that tried to

46
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,550
reveal the authentic suffering of everyday
people.

47
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,290
Then, nearly two decades later, another film
movement would take a different approach to

48
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,670
the same problem: how do you make more authentic,
irreverent movies than Hollywood?

49
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:45,530
In the late 1950s in France, a group of opinionated
young film lovers started writing for a movie

50
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,320
magazine called Cahiers du cinema.

51
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,150
At the time, the mainstream French film industry

52
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:53,500
was making a lot of unimaginative literary
adaptations that mimicked the classical Hollywood style.

53
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,640
Films like Jean Delannoy’s The Little Rebels
and Rene Clement’s war drama Forbidden Games.

54
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,010
And these young film critics hated them.

55
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,180
In 1959, one of their most prominent writers,
Jean-Luc Godard, wrote a scathing attack on

56
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,040
21 major French directors.

57
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,120
Here’s just part of what he said:
“Your camera movements are ugly because

58
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,590
your subjects are bad, your casts act badly
because your dialogue is worthless; in a word,

59
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,360
you don’t know how to create cinema, because
you no longer know what it is.”

60
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,360
Ouch.

61
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,180
The main argument of these critics was that
the studio systems – in both the United

62
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,370
States and France – were spoon-feeding their
audiences rather than respecting their intelligence.

63
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,430
Interestingly, some of the filmmakers these
critics admired had worked in Hollywood

64
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:32,329
during the height of this studio system: directors
like John Ford, Howard Hawks, Orson Welles,

65
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:33,329
and Alfred Hitchcock.

66
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:35,120
And this was even before Hitchcock was Hitchcock.

67
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,780
At the time, he was considered a reliable
maker of commercial thrillers.

68
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,629
Successful, sure, but not a genius.

69
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:42,939
These young French film critics, however,
saw a filmmaker entirely in command of his

70
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:45,730
medium – from story to cinematography to
editing.

71
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,290
They also admired a few contemporary French
filmmakers, people like Alain Resnais

72
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,290
and Agnès Varda.

73
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,599
Varda’s work, particularly her use of non-professional
actors, documentary realism, and real-life

74
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,540
locations, demonstrated that a vital, refreshing
French cinema was possible.

75
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,200
By the end of the 1950s, they had analyzed
a boatload of contemporary cinema, and were

76
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,299
ready to start making films of their own.

77
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:08,920
In 1959, four of them made their feature film
directing debuts: Jean-Luc Godard shot Breathless,

78
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,750
Jacques Rivette made Paris Belongs to Us,
Claude Chabrol made his second film Les Cousins,

79
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,089
and François Truffaut directed The 400 Blows.

80
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,679
Truffaut’s film was selected to screen at
the hugely prestigious Cannes Film Festival,

81
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,470
where Truffaut won Best Director.

82
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:25,220
Suddenly, these scrappy young critics were
being recognized as major international film

83
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,180
stars, and it put French New Wave on the map.

84
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,020
This style involved making films swiftly with
minimal crews and lightweight equipment.

85
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,740
Like WheezyWaiter... actually no crew for Wheezy Waiter.

86
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,860
Advances in camera technology, along with
faster film stocks, allowed them to shoot

87
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,680
with available or natural lighting, instead
of hauling around lights.

88
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,510
The films’ plots often felt spontaneous
and absurd, featuring tangents, casual and

89
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:48,810
irreverent humor, a frank approach to sexuality,
and sometimes obscure cinematic references

90
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:49,810
and in-jokes.

91
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:54,200
French the Llama, that’s neat!

92
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,830
They used a lot of tricks to remind audiences
they were watching a movie, to really play

93
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,800
with that illusion of reality – things like
jump-cuts or characters talking directly to the camera.

94
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,880
Like WheezyWaiter.

95
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,180
But their goal was to capture something really
authentic about life in post-war Europe.

96
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:10,110
And even though the Italian Neo-Realism and
French New Wave styles got fancy names, this

97
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,050
shift wasn’t just happening in two countries.

98
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:16,289
New generations of filmmakers began challenging
the classical Hollywood style all over the

99
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:20,849
world, from similar “New Waves” in Brazil,
England, and Spain, to post-War Japanese Cinema,

100
00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:24,280
and the rise of post-colonial Third Cinema
movements in Africa and South America.

101
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,660
In a couple episodes, we’ll spend some time
examining world cinema in more detail.

102
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,180
Meanwhile, in the United States, that 1948
antitrust lawsuit we mentioned last time – United

103
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:36,340
States versus Paramount Pictures, Inc. – forced
the major studios to give up their theater chains.

104
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,960
Suddenly, the marketplace was theoretically
open to all kinds of films, not just whatever

105
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,750
the biggest studios wanted to show in theaters.

106
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,870
The Hollywood studios were stubborn, though,
and didn’t want to give up their money and

107
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:48,680
control to the tidal wave of brash, young
filmmakers that was sweeping the rest of the world.

108
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,440
But as the 1950s rolled into the 1960s, the
studios found themselves in real trouble.

109
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,660
Boy howdy!

110
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,540
After losing their theater chains, they began
facing stiff competition from television.

111
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:03,410
As 1970 approached, the Baby Boom generation
was coming of age, the war in Vietnam was

112
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,849
in full swing, American politics was at its
most violent since the Civil War, and studio

113
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:09,580
films seemed increasingly out of touch.

114
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,280
Ticket sales were falling, and studio executives
were in an outright panic.

115
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,460
Studio Executives like money, you guys.

116
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,760
So in the late 1960s, a set of films seized

117
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,420
the opportunity to challenge the studio system
from both inside and outside.

118
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,460
Two New York based magazine writers; David Newman and Robert Benton

119
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,520
wrote a script called "Bonnie and Clyde" about a pair of charismatic depression era bank robbers

120
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,480
on a crime spree.

121
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,120
Their goal was to create an American film

122
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,420
in the style of the French New Wave, and in
fact they almost got François Truffaut

123
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,430
to direct it.

124
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,750
Arthur Penn directed the film instead, starring
Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, and after

125
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,620
winning over some influential critics, it
became a sensation.

126
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,970
With its unapologetic sexuality, casual humor,
and surprisingly brutal violence, Bonnie and

127
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,570
Clyde was a watershed moment in the history
of American film.

128
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:51,280
It was made by Warner Brothers, but the film’s
success led to a cascade of independent films

129
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,530
– films made outside the major studio
system.

130
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:57,500
In 1969 Dennis Hopper partnered with Peter
Fonda to make a motorcycle road movie set

131
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,319
to a contemporary rock-and-roll soundtrack.

132
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:03,790
Produced on a shoestring budget, Easy Rider
became a massive financial and cultural success.

133
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:07,940
In many ways, these two films – along with
movies like The Graduate in 1967 and Midnight

134
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:13,280
Cowboy in 1969 – ushered in an era of surprisingly
personal, idiosyncratic American filmmaking…

135
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,060
and proved that unique, original films could
also make money.

136
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,240
And so could Dustin Hoffman.

137
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,080
At the same time, the older generation of
studio executives began to retire.

138
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,120
They probably were okay though. They probably retired on a beach somewhere very nice.

139
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,400
In their place came a new crop of Hollywood
decision makers who were shaped by the same

140
00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:31,960
societal forces as the younger filmmakers
– like the rise of the counterculture, and

141
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,310
Watergate-era politics.

142
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:36,470
Suddenly, filmmakers with original visions
who wanted to tell risky stories could get

143
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,780
financed by major Hollywood studios.

144
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,280
And that's the way it stayed until this day. NOPE!

145
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,020
Directors like Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford
Coppola, Brian de Palma, and Robert Altman

146
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:48,580
were supported by big studios, and made
films that reached an audience hungry for

147
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,409
something new and fresh on screen.

148
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:54,389
This window of creative control and experimentation
came to be called New Hollywood Cinema and

149
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:56,979
lasted from about 1967 to 1980.

150
00:07:56,979 --> 00:07:58,960
And it came to an end for a few major reasons.

151
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,410
Many of these New Hollywood filmmakers began
working with larger and larger budgets, which

152
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,780
put more pressure on them to succeed at the
box office.

153
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,419
For every Apocalypse Now – a film that seemed
like a disaster that turned out to be a success

154
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:11,610
– there was a Heaven’s Gate – a film
that appeared to be a sure bet that flopped

155
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,110
so hard it ruined a studio.

156
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,979
And at the same time, filmmakers like Steven
Spielberg and George Lucas were creating movies

157
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:20,470
like Jaws, Star Wars, and Raiders of the Lost
Ark. Heard of 'em?

158
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:24,580
Instead of overtly wrestling with the socio-political
upheaval of the ‘60s and ‘70s, these films

159
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,880
offered a chance to escape, a more pure form of entertainment that appealed to a wider audience.

160
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,500
These were the first summer blockbusters,
and their unexpected success signaled a swing

161
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,230
away from the more risky, personal films of
the previous decade.

162
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:38,820
Plus, as all this was happening, the studios
were being purchased by large, multinational

163
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,700
corporations, which changed the way the studios
worked.

164
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,400
...no multi-national corporation ever purchases me.

165
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:48,240
Gone were the days when a cigar-chomping studio
boss decided which films got made based on

166
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,250
his gut instinct.

167
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,901
Instead, there were stockholders to satisfy,
marketing departments to consult, and risk

168
00:08:52,901 --> 00:08:54,100
assessments to consider.

169
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,140
Very corporate. Oooo, I love me some risk assessment.

170
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,710
Film had always been a mix of art and commerce,
but this period of blockbusters and corporate

171
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,520
culture forever changed that balance.

172
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,090
The major studios spent much of the 1980s
making big movies that appealed to as many

173
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:10,550
people as possible – films like E.T., Back
to the Future, Die Hard, and Dirty Dancing.

174
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,600
And, once again, the more unusual American
films had to find other funding.

175
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,040
The 1990s saw the arrival of a new set of
independent filmmakers and mini-studios.

176
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,560
Directors like Spike Lee, Steven Soderbergh,
Paul Thomas Anderson, and Quentin Tarantino

177
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,940
made films for independent companies like
Miramax and New Line Cinema.

178
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,170
It’s not a coincidence that many of these
filmmakers came of age admiring the films

179
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,170
of the New Hollywood Cinema.

180
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,710
And while they didn’t have the resources
of the major film studios, the success of

181
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:36,750
films like Do the Right Thing; sex, lies,
and videotape; and Pulp Fiction showed there

182
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,700
was still a hunger for risky, original American
films that continues to today.

183
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,420
Today we talked about the rise of post-war
film movements that reacted against the classical

184
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,850
Hollywood filmmaking style.

185
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:49,440
We saw the influence of Italian Neo-Realism
and the French New Wave on the New Hollywood

186
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,300
Cinema filmmakers of the 1970s.

187
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,660
And we discussed the rise of the blockbuster
of the 1980s and the resurgence of independent

188
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,950
filmmaking in the 1990s.

189
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:00,270
Next time, we’ll look at home video and
how streaming services like Netflix and Hulu

190
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,400
are a major force in recent film history.

191
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,000
Crash Course Film History is produced in association
with PBS Digital Studios.

192
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,100
You can head over to their channel to check
out a playlist of their latest amazing shows,

193
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,390
like PBS Infinite Series, It’s Okay to be
Smart, and Gross Science.

194
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,700
This episode of Crash Course was filmed in
the Doctor Cheryl C. Kinney Crash Course Studio

195
00:10:15,700 --> 00:00:00,000
with the help of these risk assessments and our
amazing graphics team, is Thought Cafe.
