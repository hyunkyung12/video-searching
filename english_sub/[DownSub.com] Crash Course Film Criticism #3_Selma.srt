00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,220
Thanks to Curiosity Stream for supporting Crash Course.

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,180
In 1965, a brave and dedicated group of people
were a part of one of the greatest non-violent

3
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,580
Civil Rights demonstrations in U.S. history.

4
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:23,869
Led by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the march
from Selma, Alabama to the state capitol of

5
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:26,590
Montgomery was a turning point in the fight
for voting rights.

6
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:31,450
The march’s organizers endured insults,
threats, physical violence, self-doubt, internal

7
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:35,460
division, and even death in the struggle to
guarantee access to the ballot box.

8
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,180
It took almost 60 years to bring that story
to the screen.

9
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,830
And when Selma finally arrived in 2014, it
was greeted with cheers and awards… along

10
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,160
with complaints and questions about its historical
accuracy.

11
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,920
As film critics, our job is to apply different
critical lenses to a film, to help us unlock

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,059
different meanings.

13
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:57,280
So critiquing a film like Selma through a
framework of history is one way to do it,

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,020
but it’s certainly not the only way to
evaluate it as art.

15
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:12,840
[Intro Music Plays]

16
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,520
It took nearly a decade for Selma to get made.

17
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:18,500
The film’s producers worked with a number
of directors and sought funding from a lot

18
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,310
of sources before they hit upon the perfect
combination of talent and vision in Ava DuVernay.

19
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,120
As a woman and a person of color, DuVernay
stands out among modern American feature filmmakers.

20
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,580
She had only directed two small independent
films before bringing her unique perspective

21
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,590
to Selma.

22
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:37,560
And, in fact, with Selma she became the first
woman of color ever to direct a Best Picture nominee.

23
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,220
Which is… an honor, but also really depressing
because it reveals a serious lack of inclusion

24
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,220
in Hollywood.

25
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,200
The American studio system has a long history
of denying underrepresented voices positions

26
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,320
of power behind the camera and at the film
studios who actually decide which movies get made.

27
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:56,000
Ava DuVernay has emerged as a leading figure
pushing Hollywood to include women and people

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,380
of color a seat at those tables.

29
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,130
As she puts it, “There’s a ‘belonging’
problem in Hollywood.

30
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,750
Change has to happen.

31
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,580
Inclusion is necessary for survival.”

32
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,840
Written by Paul Webb, the script for Selma
takes place over three months as Martin Luther

33
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,120
King, Jr., played by David Oyelowo, presses
President Lyndon Johnson to pass the Voting Rights Act.

34
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,660
King: Now, you asked how you can help.

35
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:24,160
King: We want Federal legislation granting negros the right to vote unencumbered.

36
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,050
At the time, many state governments kept African-American
citizens from registering to vote with administrative

37
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,610
hurdles, intimidation, and outright fraud.

38
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,480
We watch as King struggles to convince Johnson
to do something about this problem, using

39
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,850
non-violent tactics to force his hand.

40
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:42,250
Not to mention, King is also navigating divisions
within the Civil Rights movement and his own

41
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,690
strained marriage.

42
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,550
All while he’s under constant FBI surveillance!

43
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:50,360
King’s followers try three times to cross
the now-infamous Edmund Pettus Bridge to start

44
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,450
their 54-mile march to Montgomery, Alabama.

45
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:59,570
During these attempts, the marchers are beaten,
whipped, tear gassed, and in some cases killed.

46
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:04,430
It's only after this brutality is aired on national
TV,  that Johnson finally sends the Voting Rights

47
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,520
Act to Congress and the national guard to
protect the marchers.

48
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,480
And the film ends with King’s speech on
the steps of the State House, along with one-sentence

49
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,270
subtitles explaining what key characters would
go on to do.

50
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:18,680
Selma is a historical drama, and many of the
film’s critics honed in on the history,

51
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,570
comparing the events and people to their real
life counterparts.

52
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,900
But as James L. Deutsch pointed out in The
Journal of American History, there were many

53
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,850
historical films released in 2014 – from
Unbroken and The Imitation Game, to Wild and

54
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:30,900
American Sniper.

55
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,901
And of those films, it was Selma that “sparked
the most acrimonious debates in op-eds and

56
00:03:35,901 --> 00:03:39,280
newspaper columns, radio and television talk
shows, [and] the blogosophere.”

57
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,180
He goes on to say, “This is not surprising,
given the contentiousness that surrounds issues

58
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,790
of race in the twenty-first-century United
States.”

59
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:50,350
Now, used correctly, historical analysis
is a perfectly valid way to evaluate a film.

60
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:54,230
As long as there have been movies and television
depicting historical events, there have been

61
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,160
audiences who take them as pure fact.

62
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,620
So it’s important for films to get at least
some of those real life events right.

63
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,680
Stray too far and you can really mess up history
in people’s minds **cough cough** Braveheart

64
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,130
And Selma definitely does alter some history

65
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,959
in favor of drama at times.

66
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,709
For one thing, the film changes the order
of key events.

67
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,490
It opens with King accepting the Nobel Peace
Prize.

68
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:18,660
And we listen to his acceptance speech over
a transition to a new scene, where children

69
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,800
are descending a stairway only to be killed
by a bomb.

70
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,910
Now, both these events happened, but the film
leads us to believe they happened close to

71
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,030
the same time.

72
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,840
In real life, though, the bombing took place
more than a year before King spoke in Oslo.

73
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,380
Other critics point to the scenes between
President Johnson and Dr. King, suggesting

74
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,520
that the film doesn’t give Johnson enough
credit for supporting voting rights.

75
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,960
Johnson: Well Dr. King, you've certainly given me something to think about...

76
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,780
Johnson: ...but, this administration is going to set this aside for a while.

77
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,840
The film also suggests that the events of
Bloody Sunday were broadcast live across the

78
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,080
country, as Alabama State Troopers brutalized
the peaceful marchers on their first attempt

79
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,610
to cross the bridge out of Selma.

80
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:02,580
DuVernay intercuts this violence with shots
of horrified viewers in living rooms throughout the U.S.

81
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,800
But, in reality, the national news didn’t
broadcast the attack until five hours later.

82
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,090
Much of the nation did react, they just
didn’t do it in real time.

83
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,840
So does Selma take liberties with the facts
of history?

84
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,840
For sure.

85
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,169
After all, it’s a dramatic interpretation
of that history.

86
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:22,100
If you think adapting a novel is tough, just
try adapting reality into a movie.

87
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,190
How things happen, when things happen, and
where things happen in life are genuinely

88
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,880
cluttered and difficult to fit into a linear
narrative.

89
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,880
To condense all of that into a 2 hour experience
that not only makes sense but is emotionally

90
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,370
potent is more than a little challenging.

91
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,180
Which also brings up another point.

92
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:43,080
Films, even most documentaries, aren’t intended
to be a list of events as they happened, devoid

93
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,370
of emotional impact.

94
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,680
They are intended to move us, and move us
from a perspective.

95
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,570
Usually, the director’s perspective.

96
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:54,169
And when a film gets right as many events
as Selma does, a purely historical analysis

97
00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:57,660
doesn’t seem like the most useful form of
film criticism to evaluate it.

98
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,930
There’s a school of thought that says the
first few minutes of a well-constructed movie

99
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:04,860
will teach us how to watch it, so we can start
by delving into those first scenes.

100
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,040
The film opens with King’s words spoken
over a black screen.

101
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,720
It’s not the booming voice of his most famous
speeches.

102
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,620
It’s soft, low, and almost tentative.

103
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:20,120
King: I accept this honor for our lost ones.  Whose deaths pave our path.

104
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,790
The first shot is a close-up of King facing
the camera in a dark room, practicing a speech,

105
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,010
and doing a terrible job of tying an ascot.

106
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:30,860
Then his wife, Coretta Scott King, played
by Carmen Ejogo, enters the room.

107
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,490
She helps him tie the ascot, and we get an
intimate view of their relationship.

108
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,620
The lighting is dark and the framing is relatively
still, isolating these two as they struggle

109
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,949
to balance their work, their public personas,
and their marriage.

110
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:45,020
In the next scene, King receives his Nobel
Peace Prize.

111
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,140
DuVernay now uses more traditionally heroic
angles, keeping us slightly lower than King

112
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,970
and craning up, making him seem larger than
life, the public figure of popular myth.

113
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:58,259
These scenes give us two different Kings,
one private – introspective and doubting

114
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,990
– and one public – confident and majestic.

115
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,949
Finally, the third scene gives us those kids
walking down the church stairs.

116
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:08,650
When the bomb goes off, it rips through the
wall, cutting them off mid-sentence.

117
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,850
The violence is unexpected and immediate.

118
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:11,850
It’s shocking.

119
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:14,100
Then, DuVernay does something interesting.

120
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:19,230
As the explosion blows apart both brick and
flesh, she slows the images down until they’re

121
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,230
almost abstract.

122
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:25,440
It becomes difficult to tell people from objects
as they whirl across the screen, crossfading

123
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,310
into one another in slow motion.

124
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:31,960
This extends the horror, but also suggests
that the aftermath of this kind of racist

125
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,130
violence will last much longer than the bomb
itself.

126
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:39,680
This third scene also underlines the main
duality of the film – the collision of private

127
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,229
and public spaces.

128
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:45,410
This intimate childhood moment is invaded
by a terrorist’s explosive.

129
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,050
And these themes show up again and again throughout
the rest of the film.

130
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:52,270
The framing of that first shot, with King
squared off to the camera, is repeated often

131
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:55,530
– from King and his aides to regular people
joining the march.

132
00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:00,780
By presenting their characters boldly, unapologetically,
facing off with us, DuVernay and her cinematographer

133
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:05,020
Bradford Young reinforce the idea that this
movie is about people demanding their dignity

134
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,420
in the face of both incredible violence and
apathy.

135
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:11,490
This film also keeps exploring the juxtaposition
of private and public spaces.

136
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:16,290
In intimate moments, DuVernay’s King lowers
his guard and shares his fears.

137
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:20,350
These scenes are almost always shot at night,
in houses, churches, and jail cells.

138
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:24,520
In an early scene, King makes a late-night
phone call to gospel singer Mahalia Jackson

139
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,330
after an emotional low-point.

140
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:31,270
She sings “Take My Hand, Precious Lord”
as King gathers strength, alone, in his dark

141
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,270
kitchen.

142
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:35,870
Echoing that scene much later, King goes for
a midnight drive with John Lewis, one of his

143
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:39,240
youngest supporters, and expresses grave doubts
about their mission.

144
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,040
This time, instead of a song, Lewis speaks
about his own experience being inspired by

145
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,060
King and urges him to continue on his path.

146
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:52,620
Lewis: The next day, I found myself patched up, and sittin' in a church.

147
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:59,480
Lewis: Barely hold my head up, but I needed to be there. You were gonna be speaking.

148
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,870
This public-private juxtaposition is also
embodied in David Oyelowo’s performance.

149
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,860
King’s physicality and vocal cadence change
depending on his audience.

150
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,470
From restrained but firm with Johnson, to
soft and anguished with Coretta, and righteous

151
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,480
before the microphones.

152
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,240
This version of King is a close examination
of what it means – and what it costs – for

153
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,879
people of color to code switch, or change
their style of presentation to fit the moment.

154
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,570
That said, no space was totally private
for King, either.

155
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:30,889
At key points throughout the movie, subtitles
on the screen give us notes from the FBI surveillance

156
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:34,589
logs with details about King’s movements,
visitors, and phone calls.

157
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:39,089
It’s a chilling reminder that even his most
intimate moments are being monitored.

158
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:43,490
The examination of public and private space
comes up in scenes without King, too.

159
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:47,360
Oprah Winfrey plays Annie Lee Cooper, a character
who tries to register to vote.

160
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,879
She approaches the county clerk who humiliates
and threatens her, before finally denying

161
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:54,589
her application – for the fifth time!

162
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:58,730
The message is clear: public spaces in this
part of the South were effectively off-limits

163
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,470
to a big chunk of the population.

164
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:04,089
Political figures like President Johnson and
the George Wallace, the white supremacist

165
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:08,790
governor of Alabama, also privately struggle
with their own doubts in interior scenes – but

166
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,199
always during the daytime.

167
00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:12,519
They have power, the movie tells us.

168
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:14,739
The question for them is how they’re going
to use it.

169
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:19,149
In the film’s climactic moments, these public
and private spaces finally collide and are

170
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:20,819
punctuated by destruction.

171
00:10:20,819 --> 00:10:24,739
When an Alabama State Trooper shoots an unarmed
black man, or thugs beat to death a white

172
00:10:24,739 --> 00:10:28,540
pastor from Boston, DuVernay again slows the
action.

173
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:32,019
She forces us to endure the violence and contemplate
its aftermath.

174
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:35,550
Both these acts of violence take place at
night, which the film has already coded as

175
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,670
private space.

176
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:41,110
But then DuVernay breaks this pattern to depict
the Bloody Sunday violence, again in slow

177
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,199
motion, when marchers were beaten on the Edmund
Pettus Bridge.

178
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:48,019
It takes place in broad daylight, under the
watchful eye of television cameras.

179
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:51,569
And this is where the film crosscuts between
the public violence and the folks at home

180
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:54,529
– in their private spaces – recoiling
in horror.

181
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:58,689
Even though it breaks the historical chronology,
intercutting these events completes the theme

182
00:10:58,689 --> 00:11:02,760
of the movie, thrusting the usually private
pain and violence into the glaring light of

183
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,980
public scrutiny.

184
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:08,480
Once again, DuVernay is using the tools of
cinema here – shots, cuts, and sound – to

185
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,819
reinforce her film’s message in subtle and
sophisticated ways.

186
00:11:11,819 --> 00:11:15,321
There are lots of other things to say about
Selma, on matters from race and class, to

187
00:11:15,321 --> 00:11:17,199
gender equity and social justice.

188
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:21,379
But almost all of it can be read in terms
of this tension between public and private

189
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:23,619
spaces and the ways people inhabit them.

190
00:11:23,619 --> 00:11:28,389
DuVernay brings Martin Luther King Jr. down
to earth, revealing his human struggles.

191
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:32,449
And then, in the last low-angle medium shot
of his speech in Montgomery, she returns King

192
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:35,990
to his mythic status as one of the great American
leaders of the 20th century.

193
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:41,509
While she hasn’t stuck directly to the historical
record, she has made an enduring and resonant

194
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:43,309
portrait of an American hero.

195
00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:47,240
Next time, we’ll turn back the clock to
tackle Where Are My Children, a much older

196
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,440
film that wrestles with some surprisingly
modern themes.

197
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,720
