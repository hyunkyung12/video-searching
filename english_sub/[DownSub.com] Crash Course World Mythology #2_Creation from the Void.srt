00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,140
Hi, I'm Mike Rugnetta, this is Crash Course Mythology, and today, we're going to talk about a small, easy topic:

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,360
The creation of the Universe.

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,120
This is the first of several episodes on creation stories,

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,520
and this one will center on myths that imagine a universe created out of nothing.

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,020
Or possibly something.

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,500
Sometimes out of water–

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,980
Probably water, but it's magical water.

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,800
It's primordial water.

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,260
Hey Thot, do Egyptian gods drink water?

10
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:32,140
[Intro Music]

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:41,320
Myths that describe creation as coming out of nothing are some of the hardest to get our heads around.

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,080
In Latin, the phrase "ex nihilo" is used to describe this type of creation,

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,400
and it can cause a bit of existential dread for people who are uncomfortable

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,660
with the idea of absolute nothing.

15
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,600
No time, no space, just an infinite void.

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,180
Like when the Wi-Fi suddenly goes down.

17
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,120
But just, much, much worse.

18
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,120
Just ask Hephaestus, Greek god of technology.

19
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,240
That guy knows about unstable rooter architecture.
And hammers.

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,520
The ex nihilo creation story that's probably the best known in the West comes from the Book of Genesis.

21
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,860
In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth. And the Earth was without form, and void;

22
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:22,320
and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.

23
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,560
So, in this story, the main character is God.

24
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,560
And hey, let's take just a quick minute to remember that this is mythology not religious studies,

25
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,220
so we're gonna be refering to the judeo-christian God as a character.

26
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:38,200
So take a second, to just get confortable with that...
And now let's move on.

27
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,600
So, this character exists before anything we would call "the world."

28
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,260
Where does God exist? It's unclear. 
There's a void, there's water,

29
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:51,320
which are handy if God needs storage space or is thirsty but... that's about it.

30
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,040
Ex nihilo creation stories are common in the ancient Near East,

31
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,340
the Mediterranean world where the Abrahamic religions–Judaism, Christianity, and Islam–originated.

32
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:05,140
Egypt was part of an interconnected Mediterranean system, and one of its creation myths

33
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,800
also posits a universe coming from nothing, as we can see in this fragment.

34
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,360
"I am the eternal spirit, I am the sun that rose from the primeval waters.

35
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,920
My soul is God, I am the creator of the word. Evil is my abomination, I see it not.

36
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:28,060
I am the creator of the order wherein I live, I am the word, which will never be annihilated

37
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,640
in this my name of "soul."

38
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,500
Take away the first person pronoun and the bold claims, and you can see the similarities to the Genesis story.

39
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:41,680
There is an eternal God who creates the world, and then there are waters out of which rise...

40
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,540
well, in this case it's the sun, which is nice.
Just ask Ra, Egyptian sun god.

41
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,960
Cause eventually humans would realize that some of us look better with a tan, me especially.

42
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,440
I don't know about you, but I have a hard time conceiving of nothingness.

43
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,800
I'm a lot more accustomed to... "thingness".

44
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,880
I mean isn't nothingness... a thing, in and of itself?

45
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,620
And hey even more importantly, can we really call it "nothingness" with all this water around?

46
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:12,460
Fortunately for people like me, there's a word to describe the condition before creation: Chaos.

47
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:19,540
Which mythologist David Leeming defines as "the primal void or state of uniform nondifferenciation

48
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:24,280
that precedes the creation of the world in most creation myths."

49
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,680
Chaos is something of a background in many of these myths.

50
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,280
As it is in the Greek version of creation found in The Theogony by Hesiod, a poet and sheep farmer,

51
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,240
who probably lived in the 8th century BCE.

52
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:42,620
According to this version, "Verily at the first Chaos came to be, but next wide-bosomed Earth."

53
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,780
Not much to go on there, but as we can see,

54
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:50,780
Chaos is what we have before a deity or deities roll up, and provide order.

55
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,560
And also the Earth apparently has breasts.
Mother Earth, I guess? Makes sense.

56
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,100
In many myths, an augural way to put things in order is to bring light out of darkness.

57
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,400
In one creation myths from the Kono people of Guinea,

58
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,200
the darkness before creation is inhabited by Death, his wife and his daughter.

59
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,320
In the beginning, there was darkness.

60
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,440
And in it lived Death called Sa with his wife and daughter.

61
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,540
The three of them were all that was.

62
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,100
There was nowhere for them to live comfortably, so Sa started it.

63
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,280
He used magic power and he made an endless mud sea.

64
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,520
In this mud place Sa built his house.

65
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,040
After that the god Alatangana came to visit Sa.

66
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:37,140
He found Sa's house dirty and dark. Alatangana thought Sa should do better than that and he said so.

67
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,120
"Nothing can live in such a place," the god told Sa.

68
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,940
"This house needs fixing up, everything is too dark."

69
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,180
So Alatangana thought he'd better take things in hand.

70
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,120
He made the mud solid– we now know it as Earth.

71
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,540
"The Earth feels sad," God said. "I will make plants and animals to live on it." So he did.

72
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,780
And that... is how we got Home Renovation–just kidding, I love this myth.

73
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:06,580
I love that God thinks that the earth is sad and so he gets the earth a puppy to cheer it up.

74
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,620
A puppy, and some plants.
You know, spruce up the joint.

75
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,940
But notice that there are a lot of similarities between this myth and the Egyptian myth.

76
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,240
In that both describe a vast sea.
One of mud, one of water,

77
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,980
and that there is a god who exist previous to, and outside of the void, and the darkness.

78
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:31,560
Though the Kono myth differs, and that implies that Death is the one constant in the universe.

79
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,000
Oh no! And now i'm worried about the puppy.

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,580
But, why all this talk about water?

81
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:41,200
Well, we don't know exactly, but if you're living in an ancient society,

82
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,400
and you try to think through something as big as the creation of the universe,

83
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,560
you probably turn your thoughts to the vastest thing you were aware of:

84
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,660
the sky, and the sea.

85
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,500
Even if you only experience the ocean from the relative safety of the shore,

86
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,160
there is something unknowable and eternal about it,

87
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:05,760
that makes it possible to imagine the sea existing for all time. And even before time itself.

88
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:11,660
And according to theories of evolution, the idea that all life came from the sea is fairly accurate.

89
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,860
But let's not get into evolution here, we'll leave that to Hank and the scientists over at Crash Course Biology.

90
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,900
Hey fun fact, though: the western hemisphere has water too.

91
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,980
And we have some ex nihilo creation stories of our own

92
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:26,880
One of the most difficult and fascinating comes from the Maya of Guatemala,

93
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,720
and is recorded in the Popul Vuh, or "the book of the community."

94
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,620
It's not as catchy in translation.

95
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:37,420
In this complex story, creation occurs four times.

96
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:41,940
But it begins, like the Gospel of John in the New Testament, with the Word.

97
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:46,140
And just because I think it's going to be fun to watch Thought Bubble animate nothingness,

98
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,720
let's see this myth there.

99
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,860
Hey, Thoth. Pass the popcorn.

100
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,720
The world began long ago in a place called Quiché, where the Quiché people lived.

101
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,800
There no one, at first. There was not one animal yet.

102
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,860
And no bird fish or tree.
There was no rock, or forest, no canyon, no meadow.

103
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:07,360
There was Sky, separated from all things.
The face of the Earth was invisible.

104
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,500
There was nothing that could make a sound.
There was the sea, so calm and all alone.

105
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,420
There was dark, and night, and sea murmurings, ripplings.

106
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:21,880
Yet within the dark, and night, and sea, there was the maker, and there was the feathered serpent.

107
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,900
And they brought their words together.

108
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,980
Joined them with their thoughts.
Planned creation.

109
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:33,080
Their words and thoughts were so clear, that whatever they said, came to be.

110
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,980
And the serpent and the maker thought about the nature of the world.

111
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:40,260
What would be light and dark, who would bring food, and what everything should look like.

112
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,920
And then by speaking their thoughts, they brought the world into existence.

113
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,280
Starting with Earth, and then moving on to its features like mountains, and trees.

114
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,960
Followed by wild animals.

115
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,340
But there was a problem:

116
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:55,860
the wild animals were unable to speak the names of the maker and a feathered serpent.

117
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:01,300
As well as the other gods who helped bring about creation. And they were unable to praise the gods.

118
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,300
Thus the first creation was a failure.

119
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,900
The maker had to start over again,

120
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:09,400
but not before explaining to all the wild animals their lot was to be brought low.

121
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,920
Which, considering the fact that the maker and the feathered serpent organized things this way,

122
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,660
seems at least a little unfair.

123
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,160
You–bird, deer, you will stay where you are,

124
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,660
where you sleep and eat, in the forest and canyons, among the tree and bush.

125
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,360
You will be eaten, you will kill and be killed.

126
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,400
You will stay low and serve, since you cannot talk and praise your god.

127
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,179
Thanks Thought Bubble.

128
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:35,679
This particular myth is fascinating for a number of reasons.

129
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,879
First of all, it reminds me of the story in Genesis, of Adam giving names to all the animals,

130
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,600
and establishing humanity's dominion over all non-speaking creatures,

131
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:50,300
providing a single reason why humans should be considered special among all animals:

132
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:56,360
we have the power of speech, and by extension, the power to invent and tell creation stories of our own.

133
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,000
Just ask Anansi, African spider god of stories–
Thot, don't eat him. This is not Australia.

134
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,360
Even though this myth doesn't focus on Chaos, or the void or nothingness,

135
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,520
it does have the idea that before creation, there was nothing. Except God, or the Word.

136
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,300
And like the creation myths we looked at earlier, it include an endless sea.

137
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,940
A physical manifestation of things unknown.

138
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:25,680
But also of the source of life, since nothing we can see exist without water.

139
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,240
Especially people, but especially fish.

140
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,320
We'll spend a little more time in the cosmic ocean in our next episode,

141
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,500
when we look at eggs, seeds, and Earth-divers.

142
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,980
But this creation story is elaborate.

143
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:42,640
Since creation 1.0 doesn't go so well, the maker and the feathered serpent get back to work,

144
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,860
and they have to get all the way to creation 4.0 before they resolve all of the major glitches.

145
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:52,660
And even then they're probably still some software updates  like ancient, ancient software

146
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,140
like service packs but for existence.

147
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:02,400
Before we leave the realm of ex nihilo creation, I want to give one more example: the Big Bang.

148
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,400
And a lot of you are now staring at your screens in confusion and horror,

149
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,320
and saying that this isn't a myth at all.

150
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:15,600
But remember, we're talking about significant stories, with staying power which the Big Bang certainly is.

151
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,920
So, let's try it out.

152
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,540
Hank and Phil Plait have gone over this in detail, over at Crash Course Astronomy,

153
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,580
and we've talked about it on Big History.

154
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:28,300
Here, we're going to use the version related by Brian Swimme in his book The Universe is a Green Dragon

155
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:34,860
"Imagine that furnace out of which everything came forth. This was a fire that filled the Universe–

156
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,760
that was the Universe. There was no place in the Universe free from it.

157
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,200
Every point of the cosmos was a point of this explosion of light.

158
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:50,020
And all the particles of the Universe churned in extremes of heat and pressure,

159
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:58,080
all that we see about us all that now exists was there at the beginning in that great burning explosion of light."

160
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,420
Hey, that sounds a lot like some of the most ancient myths doesn't it?

161
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:06,740
"Like all ex nihilo creation stories the Big Bang start in a time before time

162
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:12,680
and gives us an origin event, one that seems to conjure light from darkness, heat from cold."

163
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,180
And OK, unlike earlier myths it doesn't supply a god, or water,

164
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,120
but you can still appreciate the structural similarities.

165
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,500
And what's so great about fish anyway?
Oh! Sorry Thoth.

166
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,420
So, yes. Ex nihilo creation myths are unsettling.

167
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:31,280
They ask us to imagine void. Absence. Chaos.

168
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,360
But then we see how each tradition brings some order to that.

169
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,620
Order and light.
And sometimes mud.

170
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,760
Thanks for watching. 
See you next week!

171
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,000
