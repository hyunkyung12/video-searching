00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:07,220
You know what can make even the most entertaining
YouTube video really frustrating?

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,039
Bad sound.

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,880
That is, for audiences who don't rely on closed captioning.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,570
Like, what if my voice was all garbled with
static, or if my words weren’t synced up

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:15,789
to the video right now?

6
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:16,789
Annoying, right?

7
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:20,380
You might look away from a screen if the visuals
are jarring, but you pretty much always hear

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,700
a film – whether it’s dialogue that was
recorded on set, or a sweeping score added

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,700
in post-production.

10
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,420
And the sad thing is: you don’t often notice
really good sound recording and design.

11
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,380
Even though it takes just as much technical
know-how and artistry as visual storytelling does.

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,520
When sound production is most successful,
you’re not thinking about the quality of

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,550
the sound at all.

14
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:38,550
You’re feeling it.

15
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,380
You’re pulled into the story and living
in the world of the film.

[Intro Music Plays]

17
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,040
Let’s start with the basics: the audience
is gonna want to hear the characters they’re watching.

18
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,719
And that all starts with the sound department
on set, which is usually a small crew of two

19
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:02,719
to three people.

20
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,170
Its head is the Sound Mixer, also known as
the Production Sound Mixer, Location Sound

21
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,030
Recordist, Sound Engineer, or just the “sound
guy.”

22
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:14,030
This person usually supplies all the sound
equipment for the production, and is responsible

23
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,890
for recording all the sounds on set.

24
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:20,110
Every space has unique acoustics, so a good
sound mixer will try to record as much as

25
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,740
possible to make the world of the film feel
real.

26
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,120
That includes the sounds actors make in the
scene being filmed – like dialogue...

27
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,600
Batman: Where's Dent?
Joker: Those mob fools want you gone so they can get back to the way things were.

28
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,280
Joker: But I know the truth. There's no going back.

29
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,860
Joker: You've changed things... forever.

30
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,920
...slurping their tea...

...or foot stomps as they jog down

[footsteps as Marion chases Indy]

34
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,320
Plus, it includes wild sound, which is any
extra lines that are said or noises that are

35
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:04,799
intentionally created without the camera
rolling, to be added into the movie in post-production.

36
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,119
And lastly there’s room tone, the atmospheric
sound in a space filled with silent actors,

37
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:11,730
crew, and set dressing.

38
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,290
Having room tone helps the sound editors make
the world feel authentic and consistent.

39
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:20,180
The sound department’s second-in-command
on set is the boom operator, or boom op, for short.

40
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,080
This is the person you’ll see holding a
microphone on a long boom pole out over the actors.

41
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:31,460
Actors will often have small body mics, also known as lavalier mics,

42
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,840
This is mine... it's not hidden.

43
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:37,860
But the boom op is working to capture sound
from everyone and everything in each scene.

44
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,900
To do their job well, they have to really
know the script and the blocking, or how the

45
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,780
actors will physically move through a scene.

46
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,190
That way, they can position the boom in the
best place to pick up sound, while keeping

47
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,410
the mic and its shadow out of the camera’s
view.

48
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,480
On larger sets, there might be a third person
on the sound crew: the utility sound technician,

49
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,280
also known as the second assistant sound.

50
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,800
This person helps with a bunch of stuff, like:
equipment maintenance, mic placement, cable

51
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,930
management, keeping everyone quiet while filming,
or even operating a second boom.

52
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,560
Now, I already mentioned the two main mics
you’ll find on a film set: the boom mic

53
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,560
and the body mic.

54
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,250
But you have to think about a lot more than
just where you put a microphone.

55
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,770
When you’re speaking, you’re pushing air
through your vocal folds out into the world.

56
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,620
That vibrates other air molecules, making
sound waves.

57
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:22,090
So, microphones nearly always have a windscreen
to help record clean sound, and not just loud,

58
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,420
whooshing noises from the air.

59
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:28,160
It muffles air being blown directly at it
without affecting the mic’s ability to pick up sound.

60
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,680
A small windscreen is usually enough on an
enclosed set, or on a soundstage, like this one.

61
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,750
Outdoors, you might need more intense windscreens.

62
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,650
And here’s a perfect example of how great
film crews are at naming things:

63
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,560
The big ones are called dead cats… because,
well, just look at them.

64
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,890
The sound department not only has to make
sure they’re recording good sound, but they

65
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,700
have to pay close attention to what they don’t
want to capture.

66
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,610
And they can do that with microphone patterns.

67
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:53,050
A microphone pattern is a shape around a mic
where it picks up sound best, and there are

68
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,340
a few standard types.

69
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,849
Just like the camera department has to change
lenses, the sound department might have to

70
00:03:57,849 --> 00:03:59,660
change mics from scene to scene.

71
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:03,590
First, you have omni-directional mics, meaning
the mic is recording sound coming at it from

72
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,590
every direction.

73
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,610
There are a lot of situations where this is
ideal, like for recording a conversation where

74
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,440
people are sitting and talking all around
a table.

75
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,480
But on a set, you only want to hear the actors
on camera, and not all the crew behind the scenes.

76
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,660
So this mic wouldn’t be the best choice.

77
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,699
Bidirectional mics pick up sound directly
in front of and behind them, while rejecting

78
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:22,319
sound coming from the sides.

79
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:24,960
Their sensitivity pattern looks kind of like
a figure 8.

80
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,669
These mics are useful for interviews or duets
– any time when two people are directly

81
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:30,560
across from each other, with the mic in the
middle.

82
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,940
Then, there are cardioid mics, named because
their pattern is kind of shaped like a heart.

83
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,569
They pick up more sound in the direction you’re
pointing them, plus a little bit from behind

84
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:39,569
and on the sides.

85
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:43,150
A cardioid pattern is good for recording lines
from one person at a time, up close.

86
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:48,159
So lavalier mics – the ones physically attached
to actors – are usually cardioid or omnidirectional.

87
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:51,680
If you want something a little wider than
a typical cardioid, but not as wide as an

88
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,020
omnidirectional, there are subcardioid mics.

89
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,550
Or, say you’re trying to record a conversation
where a bunch of people are huddled together

90
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,520
and talking.

91
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,820
So you have several mics near each other,
and you want each one to only pick up one person.

92
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,599
In this case, a supercardioid or hypercardioid
might be your best options, because they have

93
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,159
even more directional pickup.

94
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:13,099
But the downside is that they also have more
sensitivity directly behind them, so they

95
00:05:13,099 --> 00:05:16,630
can pick up things you don’t want to hear
in the final film, like chatter from the crew.

96
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:20,119
If you need something even more directional,
like for the end of a boom pole, you can put

97
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:24,479
something called an interference tube over
a supercardioid or a hypercardioid mic.

98
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,060
This ideally makes unwanted sound waves from
the sides cancel out, and creates a lobar

99
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:33,099
pattern: you can aim them more precisely,
and pick up sound from farther away.

100
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:36,250
Because these mics are long and narrow, they’re
called shotgun mics.

101
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:40,089
So on a typical set, there’s probably a
shotgun mic on the boom pole, and a handful

102
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,810
of lavaliers on different actors or hosts.

103
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:46,529
Each of those microphones is picking up part
of the overall sound in a scene, and each

104
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:50,469
one feeds into its own track on the audio
recorder where the sound mixer is.

105
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:54,349
There, the sound mixer can adjust the mic
sensitivity and the recording levels.

106
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,360
So in the final film, the audience can hear
a soft whisper...

107
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,600
Gandalf: Fly you fools.

108
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,600
...and understand loud shouting.

109
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,440
Stansfield: Benny? Bring me everyone.

110
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,360
Benny: What do you mean, "everyone?"

111
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,280
Stansfield: EVERYONE!!!

112
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,149
And 
all this is just production sound!

113
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:18,690
We still have a whole world of post-production
to explore.

114
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:22,969
Before editing anything, the very first thing
you need to do is sync the sound with the

115
00:06:22,969 --> 00:06:23,969
camera footage.

116
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:26,349
And if you prepare during production, it’s
pretty easy to do.

117
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:27,619
Remember the 2nd AC?

118
00:06:27,619 --> 00:06:31,740
They’re responsible for the slate, which
marks each take with both a visual and an

119
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,740
audio cue.

120
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,809
To help keep track of media, the scene, shot,
and take number are written on the slate for

121
00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:39,960
the camera to see, and are called out for
the microphone to hear.

122
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,490
Nick: Scene 21 take 25!

123
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,680
And then, the 2nd AC claps the slate shut.

124
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,520
If you don’t have a slate, you can clap
your hands in front of the camera and the

125
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:49,710
mic to get the same effect.

126
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,710
[clap]

127
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,969
The goal is to make the audio levels spike,
while the camera catches the exact moment

128
00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:56,039
the clapper and the board of the slate come
together.

129
00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:00,240
That way, in post-production, you can manually
match up that audio and visual cue and...

130
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,240
voilà!

131
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,240
Your sound is synced.

132
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,939
If you want a faster way of syncing audio
and video, we’ve got you covered too.

133
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:08,360
One way is through a timecode sync, if you’re
using a digital slate.

134
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,169
The moment the clapper hits the board, a signal
is sent from the slate to the camera and the

135
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:13,169
audio recorder.

136
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:16,830
And the timecode of this exact moment is recorded
on both devices, which you can use to sync

137
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,830
everything up.

138
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,440
The second way is if your camera is recording
audio too, which won’t be used in the final

139
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,009
mix, called a guide track.

140
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,840
That way, in your editing software, you have
your video footage, camera sound, and sound

141
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,199
from the audio recorder.

142
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,259
And an audio waveform sync program can match
them all up.

143
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:35,179
Typically, an assistant editor syncs up the
sound with the visuals, and then the editing

144
00:07:35,179 --> 00:07:36,789
team cuts together the film.

145
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,520
Once the film editor and director agree on
a picture lock, meaning the visual and story

146
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,480
edit of the film is finalized, it’s time
for the post-production sound team to get to work.

147
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,160
Like the film editor, the sound editor makes
decisions based on things like story and the

148
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,169
actor performances.

149
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:53,449
The best takes for camera aren’t always
the best takes for sound, though, technically

150
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:54,889
or artistically.

151
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:58,360
And it’s up to the sound editor to make
sure the best sound takes for the film make

152
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,469
it into the final mix.

153
00:07:59,469 --> 00:08:03,009
On a bigger film, some sound editors will
be dedicated dialogue editors.

154
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:06,949
Like the name suggests, their job is to cut
for the best dialogue from production sound.

155
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:10,060
Ideally, the audio and video from the same
take will both be great.

156
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,239
That makes their job easy.

157
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:15,649
Often though, the dialogue editor has to borrow
sound from other takes or wild sound, and

158
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:18,339
sync the best takes for sound with the best
takes for camera.

159
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:21,969
This only works if the audience can’t tell
it’s been done, like if the camera is on

160
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:25,529
another character, so it takes a lot of skill
and creative editing.

161
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:29,340
If there’s not a great sound take, the crew
will bring actors back into a studio and do

162
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,229
some Automated Dialogue Replacement, or ADR.

163
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:33,839
Some actors relish ADR.

164
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,979
Meryl Streep famously loves it because mixing
separate visual and audio performances can

165
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:40,659
add complexity to what her character is conveying.

166
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:42,889
Of course, dialogue isn’t the only sound
in a film.

167
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:46,620
Sound Designers work with sound mixers and
foley artists to create the sound effects

168
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,020
that make the world of the film feel rich
and whole, from birds chirping

169
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,620
to the *pew pew* of lasers.

170
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:56,120
And music supervisors and composers work with
the director to either curate or create the

171
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,120
music of the film.

172
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,940
Adding music frequently comes at the end of
post-production.

173
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:03,360
And when it’s done well, it’s the finishing
touch that solidifies the entire film and

174
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,380
brings it to life.

175
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,910
From an actor’s whispered lines to the final
score woven throughout a film, sound helps

176
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:13,279
us go from watching a story with relatable
characters, to feeling what they feel and

177
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,420
living in their world.

178
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,910
Today we learned about all the artists involved
in production sound, and how different microphone

179
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,690
patterns are best for different situations.

180
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,810
We talked about the importance of post-production
sound and the role it plays in deepening our

181
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,089
experience of a film, and making the movie
the best it can be.

182
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:31,790
Next time, we’ll talk about the people who
see everything, from the bigger picture to

183
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:35,610
tiny details that could get overlooked on
a film set: producers.

184
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:39,920
Crash Course Film Production is produced in
association with PBS Digital Studios.

185
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,579
You can head over to their channel to check
out a playlist of their latest amazing shows,

186
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:47,350
like PBS Infinite Series, Physics Girl, and
Reactions.

187
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:51,110
This episode of Crash Course was filmed in
the Doctor Cheryl C. Kinney Crash Course Studio

188
00:09:51,110 --> 00:00:00,000
with the help of these nice people and our
amazing graphics team is Thought Cafe.
