1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,327
Hey there I'm Mike Rugnetta,

2
00:00:01,327 --> 00:00:03,480
this is Crash Course Mythology, and today,

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,600
we're going to finish up our look at pantheons with African Gods.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,160
Now some Crash Course fans are already scratching their heads because they know

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:16,120
that it's very hard to speak of African anything without drastically oversimplifying.

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,940
It's enormous and filled with diverse peoples.

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,320
Africa, as the saying goes, is not a country.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,680
It is however a song by the 80s band, Toto.

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,200
Maybe some karaoke later Thoth-- to?

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,400
*singing* "Bless the rains down in Africa"

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,200
There is no one African mythology or Pantheon,

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,940
just like there's no single Native American or Asian mythology.

13
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,600
There are similarities in the stories of different groups,

14
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,940
but no one consistent family of gods.

15
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:48,560
So this episode is going to focus on an African people with a well documented set of deities:

16
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,560
the Yoruba, of Western Africa.

17
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,460
In particular, we're going to look at their pantheon of Orishas,

18
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,840
and one very wise chameleon.

19
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,960
Yoruba is a language and a term used to describe the people who speak it.

20
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,700
Yoruba people live in the region around the Bite of Benin

21
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,840
in the countries that are now Benin, Togo, Nigeria, Ghana and Sierra Leone.

22
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,120
These regions are important:

23
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,120
they're home to millions of Africans

24
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,120
and were also centres of the African slave trade,

25
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,320
meaning Yoruba traditions travelled from Africa to the Caribbean,

26
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,320
Latin America and North America.

27
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:35,520
Some of these traditions have been modified and translated into the set of practises called Vodou in Haiti.

28
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,520
Probably you know them best as Voodoo

29
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,880
Vodun is a word in the Fon language that means "spirit".

30
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,960
Yoruba myths, however, are not the equivalent of Vodou

31
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,760
and most Vodou cults are actually a lot less intense than what you've seen in, like, horror movies and stuff.

32
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,860
The Yoruba region is currently home to many religions

33
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,860
including Christianity and Islam

34
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:01,420
and the fact that the Yoruba people have maintained their Orisha stories in the face of other religious traditions

35
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:06,040
is a testament to the power and importance of this cultural heritage.

36
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,759
The Orisha stories are similar in this way to the Native American myths.

37
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,200
Okay. Now, let's meet the teams.

38
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,680
Orishas are the gods and semi-divine heroes of Yoruba culture.

39
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,380
According to Alex Koko, "there are countless deities in the Yoruba pantheon of Orishas,

40
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:26,820
and each one of them, in one way or another, has accomplished deeds whereby the ancestors thought it was worthwhile

41
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,220
to include them in their oral traditions of story-telling,"

42
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,300
known as Eta.

43
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,960
Out of the hundreds of Orishas there are a dozen or so that feature prominently in the myths,

44
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,380
not unlike the twelve Olympians.

45
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:42,520
First, there's Olorun, AKA Olodumare, sometimes hyphenated.

46
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:48,980
He's the Great Sky Father - hey, Dad! - and ultimately responsible for the creation of world order.

47
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:55,580
Then there's Eshu, the Trickster. He, like many tricksters, represents accident and the uncertainty of life.

48
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,580
We'll look at him more closely in a later episode.

49
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:02,260
Ogun is the Giver of Iron, who is also a hunter and a warrior.

50
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,540
Like in the Greek pantheon, not all gods pair monogamously.

51
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,620
Ogun had lovers including Oya.

52
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:14,800
Oranyiman, a son of Ogun is another warrior and also a fertility god of sorts, being the creator of dry land,

53
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,660
and the shaper of infants before their birth.

54
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:22,140
So, if you know someone having a sonogram, tell them about Oranyiman; that's his handiwork.

55
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,600
Olookun is the god or godess of oceans and Olosa is the goddess of lagoons,

56
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,520
so, I imagine there are some arguments over who has jurisdiction over inlets.

57
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,420
As with other pantheons, some Orishas have dominion over natural phenomena as well.

58
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,140
The Orisha thunder god is Shango, who is also the same as Oramfe.

59
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:42,840
Zeus, Thor and Shango should meet up sometime; I bet the conversation would be

60
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,080
electrifying. I'll just see myself out.

61
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,780
Okay, alright.

62
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:53,500
Onile-Ile is the goddess of Earth's soil, and there's also Oko, the god of fields, farms and agriculture.

63
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,020
Oya is the goddess of winds and the Niger river.

64
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,560
She's one of Shango's wives.

65
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,700
Orungan is the god of air. He's the son of Aganju, god of the wilderness,

66
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,700
and Yemoja, goddess of the river Ogun.

67
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,700
And it's not all positive phenomena either.

68
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,860
Obaluaye is the god of smallpox, disease and death,

69
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,860
so I bet he's a real treat at parties.

70
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,580
You might have noticed that there is some overlap in divine responsibility.

71
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:21,440
When myths exist mostly in oral traditions and come from such a huge and diverse geographic region,

72
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,460
a certain amount of redundancy is pretty normal.

73
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,460
We saw this in the Egyptian pantheon too.

74
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,540
For instance: multiple Orishas are considered warrior gods

75
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,600
and others seem to control aspects of the human condition.

76
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,460
Ori is the god of individuality and fate,

77
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,860
while Iwa is the goddess of character.

78
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:43,280
A number of Orishas relate to regional geography like forests, particular rivers and hunting,

79
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,240
and some represent seemingly hyper-specific but key aspects of African life,

80
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,380
such as Ogiyan, the god of crushed Cassava.

81
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:55,140
Now that is a god who I bet is a real treat at a party.

82
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,240
And just for you history fans out there, this shows that not all Orishas have ancient origins;

83
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,740
Cassava was introduced to Africa as part of the Columbian exchange.

84
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:10,280
Other than Sky Dad Olorun, the most important Orisha is his oldest son Orunmila, the god of Wisdom and divination.

85
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,760
According to Leonard and McClune, "Orunmila, by reading pine nuts and cowries,

86
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:21,200
communicates Olorun's irreversible intentions and therefore, personifies fate."

87
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,040
So think of that the next time you're having pesto.

88
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:28,820
Many of the Orisha myths feature Orunmila, including the one that explains how the Orishas got their powers.

89
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,160
Oh yeah; let's go to the Thought Bubble.

90
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,960
The Orishas lived on Earth, and before they each had unique powers, they were equals.

91
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,580
Whenever they needed some special knowledge, they would ask Olorun or Orunmila for help.

92
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,080
One day, and Orisha named Oko wondered why he should have to do that.

93
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:50,360
He thought that if he had a special knowledge of a certain thing, then people could ask him, and not have to hassle Orunmila.

94
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,720
So Oko asked Orunmila for special powers, to distinguish him from humans.

95
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,300
Ogun also asked Orunmila for special power,

96
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,800
to keep the world going.

97
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,440
Soon, all the Orishas wanted powers.

98
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,240
Orunmila was distressed; he held all the Orishas in equal esteem.

99
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:10,800
He thought: "There are many powers to be shared. To whom should I give one power or another?"

100
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,040
One day he went for a walk and met Agemo, the chameleon,

101
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,040
who asked Orunmila what was wrong.

102
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,040
Orunmila explained, and Agemo responded:

103
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,780
"Perhaps it would be best to leave the distribution to chance.

104
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:28,760
Return to the sky, then send messengers to announce that on such and such a day you will pour the powers down on the Earth.

105
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,180
Let each Orisha catch what he can or retrieve it from the place where it falls

106
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,600
Whatever powers an Orisha collects in this way will be his.

107
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,760
By sending your messengers you will have given everyone equal notice

108
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,720
and no-one can say "Orunmila neglected me.""

109
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,960
Orunmila followed this advice.

110
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,640
When he sent out the messengers the Orishas said:

111
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:53,340
"Orunmila does a good thing. Thank him for us. We will receive what he rains down on us."

112
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,300
Five days later, the powers fell from the sky.

113
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,140
The Orishas waited in the fields and and ran to catch them.

114
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,260
They weren't all equally fast, strong or persistant,

115
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:08,260
so not all were able to get as large or desirable a portion of Orunmila's bounty.

116
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,920
But everyone got something.

117
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,880
Thanks Thought Bubble. So, man, I love this origin story.

118
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,040
It explains how the Orishas came to have their roles.

119
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,900
Unlike the Greek Olympians, who were seemingly born with their attributes,

120
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,660
the Orishas, while not exactly human,

121
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,900
don't have any special abilities or knowledge until Orunmila rains them down.

122
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,220
And, after he does, they're not all equal in their abilities,

123
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,600
explaining why some Orishas have a lot of power,

124
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,320
and why some just get to make really delicious side dishes.

125
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,860
Think about Orunmila for a second:

126
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,860
he seems to be all-powerful.

127
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,460
He could easily assign special characteristics to Orishas as he sees fit,

128
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,460
thus increasing his influence over them.

129
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,180
Or he could just ignore them altogether: he's powerful; why help these noobs?

130
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,600
But no. Not only does he distribute divine favours,

131
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,080
but he attempts to be fair in the process.

132
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,800
Providing a lesson for how humans, 
and especially rulers, should behave.

133
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,440
And despite his own power, Orunmila can't solve his problem without the help of a very wise chameleon,

134
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,400
demonstrating the fallibility of Orishas and the connection between their world

135
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,400
and the world of animals.

136
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,580
Animals play a big role in many African stories

137
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,580
and we're going to see more on that in a later episode.

138
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,100
This story echoes another Orisha myth,

139
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,360
featuring Olorun, that explains the human condition.

140
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,740
In this story, Olorun responds to the humans of the first city, Ile-Ife, who demand

141
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,960
inequality.

142
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,400
As one man claimed: "There is nothing that is unequal among us

143
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,400
and there is nothing to differentiate us!

144
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,600
We speak the same language, we live in the same town,

145
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,120
and we each own equal amounts of possessions!

146
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:45,140
No one among us has more than any other and yet, no one has less than anyone else.

147
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,460
There is absolutely no variety in anything in our lives!

148
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,120
Why is it that we are all the same?"

149
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,240
Like Orunmila, Olorun didn't want to give in to the humans' demands.

150
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,960
He knew that differences between people would lead to strife.

151
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,460
He sent Eshu to explain this, but the people of Ile-Ife wouldn't listen.

152
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,160
And eventually Olorun relented.

153
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,500
He sent Eshu to hand out differences to people in the marketplace

154
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,860
and woah, big surprise here, chaos ensued.

155
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,640
People complained about their individual differences;

156
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,940
one woman saying: "Why are men treating us so badly?"

157
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,100
and another: "Why are they acting superior to us?"

158
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,300
So, the next time someone makes a sexist comment,

159
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,720
blame Eshu.

160
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,820
But also the person making the sexist comment, too.

161
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:32,480
Chaos and war were bred from Olorun's inequality.

162
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,620
Eventually, the people couldn't even get along with each other and they had to leave Ile-Ife.

163
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:42,040
This caused the formation of new nations, tribes, cities and kingdoms

164
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,540
and according to the story

165
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:47,920
in this manner inequality prevailed among the people of Earth.

166
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,380
This story is a direct echo of the origins of the Orishas' powers

167
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,860
and shows just how similar the gods and humans are.

168
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,520
As with the other pantheons we've seen, gods in human form have human frailties,

169
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,400
which may make them more relatable as objects of worship,

170
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:06,000
but also makes it easier to criticise them, or see them as fallible.

171
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,840
Perhaps this helps explain why much of the world that worships a divine being

172
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,940
has chosen to put its faith in a power that, for the most part,

173
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,040
eschews human form and human emotion.

174
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,320
But. Can they make delicious Cassava?

175
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,960
Thanks for watching, I'll see you next time.

176
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:30,060
Check out out Crash Course Mythology Thoth tote bag and poster, available now at dftba.com

177
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,660

178
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,620
and is produced with the help of all of these nice people.

179
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,880
Our animation team is Thought Cafe and Crash Course exists

180
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,480

184
00:10:58,460 --> 00:00:00,000
remember: just ask a chameleon.
