1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,540
‘Mise-en-scene’ literally means “placing
on stage.”

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,410
But in film, mise-en-scene encompasses everything
the camera is capturing.

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,980
It’s the set and how it’s lit.

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,539
It’s how the subjects are framed.

5
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:15,840
It’s the actors and how they look and what
they’re wearing.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,840
It’s the props they’re holding and the
set dressing they’re moving through.

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,740
Just as every line of dialogue and every shot
should be helping to move the film forward,

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,210
everything in frame should be helping to build
the mise-en-scene.

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,120
From the overall look and feel of the sets,
to the details in makeup on the actors’

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,720
faces, everything in a film is designed and
captured for a reason.

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:45,839
[Intro Muic Plays]

12
00:00:45,839 --> 00:00:49,149
Sometimes mise-en-scene is pretty obvious:
think of the German expressionist film The

13
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:53,170
Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, or any film by Tim
Burton or Wes Anderson.

14
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:57,729
These films are clearly stylized -- the audience
can tell that the sets, costumes, and makeup

15
00:00:57,729 --> 00:01:00,160
were all created and crafted by someone.

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,400
But sometimes the mise-en-scene is more subtle,
like in the realist film Winter’s Bone,

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,510
or films by Lynne Ramsay or Kelly Reichardt.

18
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:11,090
The world portrayed in realist films might
make the audience wonder what a production

19
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,530
designer even did to build the world, because
the scenes look so much like the world we

20
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:15,530
live in.

21
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:18,060
But look carefully at the world of a realist
film.

22
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,800
Just as the cinematographer uses the language
of the camera to help tell the story, the

23
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,060
teams creating the mise-en-scene structure
the set and the actors in specific ways to

24
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,549
bring the director’s vision to life.

25
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:30,530
The production designer creates the physical
world of the film.

26
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,840
This person leads the art department, which
builds and decorates the sets.

27
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,850
Early in pre-production, the production designer
is hired to work with the director to develop

28
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,409
the look of the film.

29
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:42,720
Depending on when and where the script is
set, they’ll probably have to research what

30
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,130
to include, and exclude, when building their
world.

31
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:49,679
For example, I was in a film that took place
in the 1970s, and there was a scene shot next

32
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:51,880
to a building with corrugated metal siding.

33
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,110
Because of his experience and research, the
production designer knew that the shape of

34
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,930
that metal corrugation wasn’t developed
until the 1980s.

35
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,229
So to make the scene accurate to the time,
he had the art department bring in old corrugated

36
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:03,880
metal and hung it over the new metal.

37
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,039
This might seem silly.

38
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:09,190
I mean who, besides the production designer,
is going to know what year corrugated metal

39
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,240
changed shape?

40
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,300
But, even if we don’t know the year, subconsciously
we feel the differences.

41
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,890
Imagine a scene in a classroom from your childhood.

42
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,860
If you grew up in the 1990s and a film about
your childhood years included students writing

43
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,540
on chalk slates or if you grew up in the 1960s
and the film included a smart board, both

44
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,730
those things would feel wrong.

45
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,390
So, as soon as the production designer gets
the script, they begin researching the time

46
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,980
period and the location where the story takes
place, to get the feeling just right.

47
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,500
It might even be a time period in the future
or a make-believe place.

48
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,900
But they still start with research.

49
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,390
After that, the production designer prepares
plans and drawings for the sets that need

50
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,390
to be built.

51
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:46,610
And they go on early location scouts with
the director so they can begin planning how

52
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,720
they’ll use a location.

53
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,640
Then they’ll present the director with their
ideas for designing the setting.

54
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,990
Once they’ve agreed upon a plan with the
director, the art department gets to work.

55
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:58,190
They work with the set decorator, also called
a scenic designer, to research and implement

56
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,780
every detail they’ll bring into the world
of the film.

57
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,820
While the production designer is creating
the look of the film overall, the set decorator

58
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,340
is choosing the details and designing the
sets.

59
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,600
The production designer also works with the
art director to budget and organize the department.

60
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,600
They hire buyers who buy or rent set dressing
and props.

61
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,150
Once the set is designed, the art department
builds anything that doesn’t already exist

62
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,990
for the set itself, as well as any special
props that are needed.

63
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:25,060
The art department masterminds what the physical
world of the story looks like, but if the

64
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,240
characters don’t look and feel like they
belong in that world, then it’s all for nothing.

65
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,280
The costume designer and the wardrobe department,
along with the hair and makeup departments,

66
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,040
also play pivotal roles in creating the mise-en-scene.

67
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,280
And the work of any designer starts, again,
with research.

68
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,360
The costume designer uses pre-production to
study the setting and the time period, including

69
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,970
the season when the film takes place.

70
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:49,270
The costume designer’s most important job,
though, is to understand the characters and

71
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,890
how they grow throughout the film.

72
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,820
By developing a signature look for a character,
the designer can help convey the story’s

73
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,960
plot and themes.

74
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:00,150
Maggie Smith plays both Professor McGonagall
in the Harry Potter series, and Miss Shepherd

75
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,420
in The Lady in the Van -- two very different
characters with different backstories and

76
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,420
goals.

77
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,070
The wardrobe of the character can convey more
about them than their opening lines.

78
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:12,710
And as characters change over the course of
the story, that change is often shown outwardly

79
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,840
-- and not just in makeover montages.

80
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,820
In Jurassic World, for example, Bryce Dallas
Howard’s character Claire starts out in

81
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,100
nearly all white clothes, implying that she
never is outside with the dinosaurs and is

82
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,600
disconnected from the reality of the park
she works in.

83
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,180
But the costume designer played with what
the audience already knew of the original

84
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,901
Jurassic Park, and mapped out Claire’s wardrobe
changes to quote those of Laura Dern’s character

85
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:36,960
from the 1993 film.

86
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,620
That way, she becomes more connected with
the story and thus more capable in our minds.

87
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,790
Design decisions like this help the audience
get pulled into the film, but they also help

88
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,090
the actors get into the minds of their characters.

89
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:52,900
The director Tom Ford, who started his career
in the fashion industry, has even sewn labels

90
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,560
into his actors’ costumes so that they never
feel like costumes, but like the characters’

91
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,560
clothes themselves.

92
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,340
This extra detail isn’t something the camera
or the audience will ever see, but when your

93
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,460
job as an actor is to believe in a pretend
world while you’re surrounded by crew and

94
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,660
lights, it makes the world a little more real
and your job a little easier.

95
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:14,130
This is true not just of the clothes actors
wear, but also the makeup they use and how

96
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,130
their hair is styled.

97
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:19,840
Hair and Makeup, or HMU, are usually referred
to as a single unit on set, and they often

98
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,290
share a trailer, but they’re two separate,
specialized careers.

99
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:27,590
As with production and costume designers,
pre-production is all about research and planning.

100
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:31,230
Hairdressers work with the director to develop
how they’ll style the actors’ hair.

101
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,750
They’ll prep any dyes, wigs, extensions,
or bald caps they might need.

102
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:39,340
Because films are rarely shot in order, hairstylists
need to be organized and plan how to maintain

103
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,750
continuity throughout the film.

104
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,000
This is often a reason wigs are used instead
of dying hair.

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,460
If scheduling demands that an actor play a
grey-haired version of their character on

106
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,980
either side of a dark-haired version, for
example, then it can be easier to work with

107
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,710
wigs than back-to-back dying.

108
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:56,030
And making a wig look just as realistic as
real hair can be tricky.

109
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:00,120
If it’s a period piece, they’ll need to
know how to create a time-appropriate look,

110
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,370
but with the safety and health standards of
the current times.

111
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,580
This is true for makeup artists, too.

112
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,450
Makeup artists need to understand each actor’s
skin and create a plan that keeps the actor

113
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:12,389
as comfortable as possible while also creating
the look the film demands.

114
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:15,919
Makeup is similar to lighting or editing,
in that it usually has to be seen, but not

115
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:16,919
noticed.

116
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:20,080
Whether you’re making a beautiful person
camera ready, or building a look out of latex

117
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,020
and airbrushing, the audience needs to be
connecting with the character and their internal

118
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,180
life, not getting distracted by their makeup.

119
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,050
Some makeup artists specialize in special
effects makeup.

120
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:33,190
But all makeup artists need to know how to
create certain illusions, like cuts, bruises,

121
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,790
scars, bad teeth, and tattoos.

122
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:39,110
Of all the departments on set, makeup, hair,
and wardrobe spend the most time with the

123
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,110
actors.

124
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,580
Each department has a trailer at basecamp,
but will also send a representative to set

125
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,580
with the actors.

126
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,940
When the 1st AD calls “Last looks,” they’re
telling these three people to check the actors’

127
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,419
makeup, hair, and clothing to make sure it’s
camera ready.

128
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:55,180
It’s their job to make sure the actors don’t
have to think about these things and can focus

129
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,270
on their work of being present in the scene.

130
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:01,250
And of course, all the designers working on
a film need to communicate between departments

131
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,639
to create the mise-en-scene and help tell
the story.

132
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:07,980
A really bright example of how this can all
come together is the character Clementine,

133
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,620
in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.

134
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,790
The costume designer, hair and makeup team,
and the production designer worked together

135
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,650
to make the audience associate the color orange
with Clementine.

136
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,590
Whether it’s her hair color or her bright
orange sweatshirt, they took inspiration from

137
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,580
her name and the script and brought it into
the mise-en-scene.

138
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,930
And if you pay close attention, they give
us a big hint about the end of the movie by

139
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,070
aligning her character with that color.

140
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:31,530
That movie came out over ten years ago, so
I don’t think I’m spoiling anything by

141
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:35,010
saying that it’s about removing the memory
of Clementine from the brain of her ex boyfriend,

142
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,010
Joel.

143
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:39,900
The costume designer and the set decorator
took great care in making everything in Joel’s

144
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,590
world appear in greys and blues.

145
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:46,070
But, when Joel wakes up from having his memory
erased, everything in the scene is grey or

146
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,500
blue except one orange vase.

147
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,960
Like every real character we come to love
in our favorite movies, Clementine isn’t

148
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,060
completely erased.

149
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,830
Today we discussed the teams that play the
biggest roles in creating the mise-en-scene

150
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,830
of a film.

151
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:02,520
We talked about how the art department creates
the world the film takes place in, and how

152
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,910
the wardrobe department interprets the character
and the story through their clothes.

153
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:10,570
And we learned how the hair and makeup departments
transform the actors into their characters

154
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:11,570
on screen.

155
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,550
Next time, we’ll talk about Grip and Electric,
one of the largest crews on a set and the

156
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,630
teams that add that final touch of the mise-en-scene:
lights.

157
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:20,900
Crash Course Film Production is produced in
association with PBS Digital Studios.
