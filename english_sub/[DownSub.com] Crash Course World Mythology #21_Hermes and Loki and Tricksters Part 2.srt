00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,799
Hey there. I'm Mike Rugnetta. This is crash course Mythology, and today we're continuing with Tricksters

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,400
We're going to look at the trickster as a culture hero

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:12,269
Meaning someone whose creativity adds to the culture of the mythological world they inhabit

4
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:17,669
We're going to focus on Europe in this episode looking specifically at Hermes the greek version of Thoth here and also

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,910
Loki- who in today's myth actually somehow isn't the worst

6
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:26,879
...Sorta- I mean he does disguise himself as a biting fly so he's definitely not like the best

7
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:41,699
We haven't talked much about Hermes because there aren't too many myths where he's a main character – usually he's a messenger

8
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:48,100
More than a central focus, but hey, fun fact, he has a big presence in statuary

9
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,150
Hermes was a phallic God and all around Greece

10
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,349
You could find square pillars topped with a bust of his head and featuring a

11
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,160
male member

12
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,100
These are called herms and were frequently placed at crossroads

13
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,830
Since Hermes was also the God of travelers and rode maybe these herms were meant to

14
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:08,500
...Point travelers in the right direction?

15
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,500
Tricksters like Hermes are often associated with extreme sexual appetites and also with

16
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:19,140
Creativity a connection which makes a lot of sense when we think back to our stories about the creation of the world

17
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,060
But instead of getting into all that

18
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:27,060
Let's explore one of the most famous myths about Hermes which begins when he was just a wee little baby trickster

19
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,830
Okay, so, baby Hermes sneaks out of his cradle and killed a tortoise. I don't know what you were expecting

20
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,110
We're talking about Tricksters anyway

21
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:41,249
He turns the tortoise shell into a lyre which he starts to play inventing lyrics to accompany his music; pretty creative for a baby

22
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:47,369
He probably went to a montessori school. Then Hermes gets hungry, but not for milk: he wants some meat

23
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:53,579
So he runs to Pieria where his brother Apollo keeps his sacred cattle –Hermes steals

24
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,619
50 cows and hides them in a nearby cave. To get them into the cave

25
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:04,109
He makes them walk backwards so their footprints would be difficult to follow. He also invents some backwards

26
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,400
Sandals that hide his own tracks- again, clever baby

27
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,640
Hermes whips up a fire, kills two of the cows and roasts them

28
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,779
But doesn't eat them, which is kind of strange since he's supposedly so hungry, instead

29
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:22,679
He hides the meat and cowskins in the cave, throws his sandals in the river and covers over the fire. Then he just

30
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:28,600
strolls on back to his cradle. Apollo soon learns that some of his cattle are missing and he is furious

31
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:35,100
Despite all of Hermes' stealth efforts Apollo figures it all out and threatens to throw him into Tartarus

32
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:39,300
Hermes defends himself saying he's only a baby how could he steal 50 cows?

33
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:45,400
Apollo doesn't care how old his brother is but he can't punish Hermes without some judgment from their dad

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Zeus listens to Hermes' denials but doesn't believe him

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,400
And orders the baby to bring back all those poor cows

36
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,700
Afterward Hermes and Apollo make up and they exchange gifts

37
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,100
Apollo gives Hermes a whip as a symbol of cattle tending and the caduceus as a symbol of heraldry

38
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,460
Indicating Hermes' position as messenger of the Gods

39
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:10,200
Hermes gives Apollo the lyre he had invented and this becomes Apollo's symbol as a god of music

40
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,600
Although many Tricksters seem more human or more animal than divine

41
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,169
Hermes is definitely supernatural

42
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,140
There's obviously something pretty special about this baby

43
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:25,100
Who's not only an able thief, but a smooth talker, and a tortoise murderer to boot

44
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,229
As David Leeming observes in this myth, "Hermes has the trickster qualities of

45
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,360
deceitfulness, trickery, childishness,

46
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:35,500
amorality, humor, extreme inventiveness and great charm."

47
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:41,380
It's his inventiveness that makes him a culture hero, though- his creation of the lyre is incredibly important

48
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,339
It becomes Apollo's main instrument and one of the symbols of his divine attributes

49
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:51,880
It's also significant because songs are one of the ways stories like this one were passed down in the ancient Greek world

50
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:57,339
And there's also something interesting about Hermes having to kill an animal to create the lyre. Perhaps

51
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,040
it's a reminder that creation is often the flipside of

52
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:05,499
Destruction that the two sometimes require each other; either way in this story, Hermes' mischief is

53
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,459
Basically harmless unless you're a cow or that poor tortoise

54
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:12,849
So I guess not really harmless, just harmless by like normal deity standards.

55
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:16,600
And it ultimately brings about something positive for all involved

56
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,879
Again, except the cows and the tortoise

57
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:25,089
it also explains the origin of a mythical artifact that defines the character of the God Apollo and the

58
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,000
Greek culture that worshiped him

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,780
For our second story, we have another myth

60
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:34,570
where the trickster's mischief impacts a whole culture; as with many Norse myths it begins and ends with

61
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:42,429
Loki who is the worst; one morning Thor wakes up next to his beautiful wife Sif and sees that something is missing

62
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:50,410
Her beautiful blonde hair. Sif is understandably upset, and she begs her husband to fix the problem. Thor has a sneaking suspicion

63
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:54,820
And heads off to see Loki- at first Loki denies doing anything

64
00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:00,699
But when Thor threatens to break every bone in Loki's body, Loki admits that yes, he'd stolen Sif's hair

65
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:05,400
He'd been hitting the mead got to thinking wouldn't it be funny. You know

66
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:06,860
disappearing hair?

67
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,600
Hilarious.

68
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,200
Unsurprisingly, Thor doesn't appreciate the humor and threatens him again with a most Norse undoing

69
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,549
So Loki offers to fix the problem saying that he can get Sif even better hair

70
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,020
Thor agrees and lets Loki venture to the land of the dwarves

71
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,000
What is it with Tricksters and dwarves? After that Anansi story from the last episode

72
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,260
I have a bad feeling about this- his first stop the sons of Ivaldi, three dwarves known for their ability at the forge

73
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,849
Loki says that the gods of asgard know of their great ability

74
00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:41,000
But that really they're only the second best craftsmen among the dwarves

75
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,299
Behind the brothers Brokk and Eitri. The sons of Ivaldi declared that they will not be outdone and

76
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,479
Promised to make three treasures for the Gods- one of which Loki says must be magical golden hair

77
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:58,929
Then loki goes off to see Brokk and Eitri- you can probably see where this is headed, he tells them about what the sons

78
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:04,779
of Ivaldi are going to do and Brokk the talker says that he and his brother can outdo those Ivaldis, no problem.

79
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:11,600
Loki bets him he can't and Brokk takes the bet but says that if the gods like his and Eitri's treasures best

80
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:16,100
Brokk gets to take Loki's head; Loki accepts.

81
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:21,339
Eitri, the master craftsmen amongst the two brothers, tells Brokk to man the bellows and to keep

82
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:28,179
pumping no matter what, so the temperature of their forge remains constant. Brokk keeps up his pumping for the first two treasures

83
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,319
despite being bitten on the hand and then the neck by a large

84
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,100
pesky fly who is, of course, Loki.

85
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,889
By the time Eitri is working on the third project, Loki the fly is

86
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:44,000
really beginning to worry that he might lose the bet, so he starts biting Brokk's eyebrows.

87
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,139
At one point Brokk brushes the blood from his eyes and

88
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:53,709
just for a second breaks his rhythm. When Eitri finishes making the treasure he chastises his brother for the

89
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,050
imperfections caused by his erratic

90
00:06:56,719 --> 00:07:01,119
oxygenating, but says that his gift will have to do. Loki brings the Ivaldis

91
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,370
treasures back to Asgard, Brokk brings his and his brother's- Loki reveals his treasures first

92
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:09,400
And we reveal the thought-bubble to see who wins

93
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:14,469
The first treasure is Sif's new head of hair made from gold. When she puts the wig it fuses

94
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:21,770
with her scalp and behaves like real hair. She is ecstatic, the gods are impressed. Next, Loki presents

95
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:28,159
Odin with a spear- Gugnir- when thrown, it always hits its mark, useful for an old one-eyed

96
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,679
God with suspect aim; also, any oath sworn on Gugnir is unbreakable.

97
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,649
Odin is pleased but not effusive in his praise –

98
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:43,969
classic Dad move – the final treasure is for Freyr, brother of Freya we've discussed in the past. This treasure looks like a handkerchief

99
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:50,690
but when unfolded it becomes Skidbladnir, a magic boat big enough to carry all of the Aesir

100
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:55,700
and it will always have a fair wind, pretty great for a seagoing people.

101
00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:00,589
Loki is pleased but Brokk is still confident that his gifts will be better. First

102
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:05,540
he unveils a golden Bristle Boar, Gullinbursti. It glows in the dark, pulls

103
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:11,450
Freyr's chariot, runs over water, and goes faster than any horse; Freyr is pleased

104
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,770
but Loki says it's nothing compared to a folding ship which is just I mean come on

105
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:19,850
It's a glowing chariot boar- the next gift is a Golden armband

106
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:27,260
called Draupnir which Odin wears. Draupnir multiplies itself- every night eight identical rings drip from it greatly

107
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:31,670
enriching its owner. Why gods need gold is a bit beyond me, frankly,

108
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:38,150
but hey, Odin? Psyched. The last gift is Eitri's third project, the one erratically oxygenated.

109
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:44,059
It's a hammer and even Brokk has to admit that the handle is a little too short,

110
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:50,390
but that doesn't really matter once Thor gets his hands on it. This is Mjolnir,

111
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:56,900
an unbreakable hammer- it always hits its mark and always comes back to the hand that throws it and for Thor,

112
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:03,650
it's love at first sight- the rest of the Aesir agree because with Mjolnir, Thor will always be able to protect them from Giants.

113
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:08,210
The Aesir announced that Brokk and Eitri's gifts are the best and they're all happy,

114
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,140
except for Loki who totally dumped on himself.

115
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:12,560
Thanks thought bubble!

116
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:19,520
Now that he's lost the bet, Loki starts sweating and making excuses to Brokk, but Brokk only pulls out his knife and starts talking about

117
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,609
all the stuff he and his brother are going to make out of Loki's head.

118
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,520
Increasingly desperate, Loki starts looking to the other gods for help

119
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:31,309
but no one's buying it- a bet's a bet and Loki lost- even after cheating, Loki thinks quick:

120
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,320
He's got one more trick up his sleeve.

121
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:37,189
Loki explains that yes, Brokk does have a right to his head,

122
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,410
but that the bet didn't include any part of his neck, so he's welcome to the head,

123
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:48,859
but only if he can get it without cutting the neck. Brokk calls shenanigans and appeals directly to Odin,

124
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:53,210
but in perhaps the earliest example of getting off on a technicality, the one-eyed all-father

125
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:58,190
agrees with Loki and Brokk has to go home with his own head in his hands

126
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:02,450
instead of Loki's. Classic Trickster stories like these often involve serious

127
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:09,739
transgressions against society. In this case it's stealing and not just from humans but from other gods. Neither

128
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,989
Loki nor Hermes has a good reason for their thefts either- in fact their excuses are downright immature:

129
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:21,859
I was drunk, and I'm a baby. Though to be fair, both do end up presenting important gifts to their fellow

130
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:26,510
Gods, ones that become foundations of the stories told about them for millennia.

131
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:32,390
Loki in particular shows us that while tricksters often get away with their tricks, the result is not always a foregone conclusion.

132
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:39,200
Despite his best efforts, Loki is set to pay a stiff price for stealing Sif's hair- first at Thor's hands

133
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,629
and then at Brokk's- in both cases it's only his wit that saves him. Like Anansi,

134
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:50,539
Loki can talk his way out of a pickle and in this way provide a model for human behavior that other gods who rely on

135
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:56,060
their supernatural gifts simply can't. Most of us don't have super strength or magic hammers

136
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,729
but we all have brains and the ability to solve

137
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,140
problems even if we're the ones who made those problems for ourselves in the first place.

138
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,660
Just don't go trying to grift any rubes. You might not get lucky like Loki and you could end up losing a little bit

139
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,870
too much off the top.

140
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:17,179

Thanks for watching and if I were Brokk and Eitri,

148

I would have given Loki's head to Samson. That's a man who knows how to use the jawbone of an ass.
