00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,700
Hello!

2
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,280
My name is Mike Rugnetta and this is Crash Course: Mythology.

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,980
Mythology is a complicated subject.

4
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:12,400
It touches on literature, history, anthropology, sociology, psychology, religion, and even science.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,060
Have you ever tried to make a Slurpee,

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,320
mixing all of the flavors together?

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,560
Mythology is exactly like that,

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,440
but it's a Slurpee of knowledge,

9
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,420
with no brain freeze and a lot to learn.

10
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,180
So maybe, actually a tiny brain freeze.

11
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,420
But a different kind of brain freeze.

12
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,700
What I'm trying to say is that

13
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,420
don't be surprised if some of what you hear during the next forty or so episodes

14
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,020
echoes some of the things you may have heard in other Crash Courses.

15
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,000
And don't worry if what you hear in one episode

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,420
reminds you of what you've heard in another.

17
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,480
We do that on purpose, and usually we know what we're doing.

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,040
Right, Thoth, Egyptian god of knowledge with an awesome ibis head? Right.

19
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,160
Do ibis-headed gods like bird seed?

20
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,820
We have so much to learn ahead!

21
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:59,840
[theme music]

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,900
There are a couple of reasons mythology is a more difficult subject than some of the others we've tackled.

23
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,480
One is that many myths are very, very old,

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,660
and often exist in many versions.

25
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,820
So just keep that in mind when we discuss a particular myth in the series.

26
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,900
If you've heard the myth in a different form,

27
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,540
it doesn't mean we've gotten it wrong,

28
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,000
though that is always possible-- just ask AtÃ«, the Greek goddess of folly.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,460
It just may be that we're working from a different version of the myth.

30
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,880
We'll try to put references to the versions that we're using in the show notes.

31
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,240
Sometimes we'll even be presenting composites of a number of different tellings of these myths.

32
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,020
Another difficulty with mythology is that it's open to so many interpretations.

33
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,200
Are myths records of historical fact? Deliberate fictions?

34
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,300
Ways of understanding otherwise incomprehensible events? Misunderstanding?

35
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,180
We... are not in a position to say.

36
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,680
The kind of thing that scholars spend their entire lives arguing about.

37
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,540
Along with the myths, we're gonna present possible interpretations, but let's be clear:

38
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:04,340
these are interpretations, not facts in the sense that their meanings can be confirmed by a weight of evidence.

39
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,960
Mythology has been argued about and theorized for over a hundred years,

40
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,540
and many myths can be read and understood in a number of ways.

41
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,700
When presenting interpretations, we're gonna let you know that we're doing that

42
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,140
so that you don't think that we're presenting an interpretation as a fact...

43
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,900
because that will get us into arguments, and we would love to avoid those.

44
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,320
This is also probably a good time to point out that in many instances, the line between myth and religion...

45
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,280
is blurry.

46
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,080
And, as we're gonna explain in a minute, we're working with a definition of myth that focuses on story,

47
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,360
rather than truth.

48
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,960
When one views myths primarily as stories or as literary artifacts,

49
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:48,440
it allows you to enjoy them and think about them apart from their value as structures of religious belief.

50
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,560
So, when we recount stories from the Bible as myths,

51
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,600
we're not definitively saying that they're either true or untrue,

52
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,500
just that they're stories that people have used in a variety of ways over time.

53
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:06,300
A third problem in discussing myth is that most myths don't have nameable authors,

54
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,080
or even when they do, like Homer or Virgil,

55
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,260
it turns out these guys were really just recasting older stories into new language.

56
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,420
Most of the time, we don't know who originated myths, or how, or why,

57
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,520
but, luckily, for our purposes here, that actually doesn't matter much.

58
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,480
But the last problem we have to talk about does matter.

59
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,960
And that's the difficulty of finding a good, working definition for the word "myth."

60
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,840
This is tricky, especially given the way we use the word in contemporary English.

61
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,900
Much of the time, when we say something is a "myth," what we mean is that it's not true.

62
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:46,300
For example, the idea that you swallow eight spiders a year while you're sleeping-- it's not true. It's a myth.

63
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,900
Not sure if this applies to Australians though;

64
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,140
I would wager that you guys swallow at least eight spiders a year.

65
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,380
Everything I know about Australia I learned from the internet.

66
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,580
Because we use the term "myth" to mean something that isn't true,

67
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:03,500
we can come away with the definition of "myth" as a story that is false and not to be taken seriously.

68
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,240
But myths have been taken seriously...

69
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:12,520
by scholars, sure, but more importantly, by generations and generations of people who've heard these stories,

70
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,560
and found in them something worth telling again.

71
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,920
Which is not to say people don't question their myths.

72
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:25,120
Philosophers were writing about the absurdity of Greek myths as far back as the sixth century B.C.E.,

73
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,040
probably even earlier.

74
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:32,400
So, if a myth isn't just a story that someone made up, or a word that we use to label something as false,

75
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,280
then what is it?

76
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,720
Myth comes from the Greek word "mythos"--

77
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,860
which means "word" or, more significantly, "story."

78
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,440
That doesn't mean every myth, or even the most important ones are Greek,

79
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,800
but those will probably be the ones most familiar with our to viewers in America and Europe.

80
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,920
At least, until the new Rick Riordan series gets going.

81
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,980
And honestly, if goddesses of love, Aphrodite and Freya, ever got into an arm wrestling competition,

82
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:59,140
Aphrodite would TOTALLY dominate, because Freya cries golden tears, and Aphrodite kills people. BOOM.

83
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,360
Sorry, I get sidetracked by Greek myths;

84
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,380
that's gonna happen a lot. Just ask Hermes, Greek god of roads.

85
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,920
So, we're gonna start by saying that a myth is a story,

86
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:13,540
but it's a special kind of story, that for the purposes of this series, has two primary characteristics:

87
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,460
significance and staying power.

88
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,380
This means that the subject matter is about something important,

89
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,700
something about how the world works, or how the world itself got going...

90
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,280
how things came to be.

91
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,580
And then there's staying power.

92
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:32,260
These are stories that have survived centuries, sometimes millennia,

93
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:37,480
and this is a testament to the deep meaning or functional importance of these stories

94
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,720
to the people who hear and tell them.

95
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,500
Now, if I know Crash Course fans, there are probably some people right now saying, "Mike,

96
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:49,820
it sounds like you might lump in folktales, and maybe even fairy tales, with your myths."

97
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,840
I'm not gonna lie.

98
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,000
There may be a folktale that creeps in from time to time,

99
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,300
but we're gonna steer clear of fairy tales for the most part.

100
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,400
For die hard folklorists-- and yes, that is a thing--

101
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,680
proper myths only deal with the creation of the world, or maybe the universe, and thus,

102
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,840
all real myths are religious... or quasi-religious.

103
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,580
Mythology theorists who come at myths from a religious studies angle

104
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:16,100
tend to say that the main characters of myths must be gods...

105
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,760
but this leaves out hero stories, which I think are pretty important, and also,

106
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,520
those are the ones with the sea monsters, so we're gonna include those too.

107
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,540
There are also those myths that don't feature any supernatural elements at all--

108
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:30,160
what Professor Robert Segal calls "beliefs," or "credos."

109
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,220
Most Americans will be familiar with the "rags to riches" story of the American dream.

110
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,740
Those stories are myths-- not because they aren't true

111
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,560
(sometimes poor people do become rich and successful in spite of tough upbringings,

112
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,060
and largely because of grit and hard work);

113
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,020
they're myths not because they have religious significance,

114
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,720
they're mythic because of their staying power...

115
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,980
and the tenacity with which proponents of the myth take them to be true.

116
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:01,000
Because these types of stories fit into our broad definition of a significant story

117
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,800
where personalities are the lead characters,

118
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,820
we will be talking about them-- but only in a later episode.

119
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:11,620
At this point, it might be a good idea to give an example of the kind of stories we'll be talking about in this series.

120
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,140
And, to do so, I'm gonna go to Greece.

121
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,220
YAY!! Greece!

122
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:20,220
Wine dark seas, delicious olives, beautiful ruins, anti-austerity protests,

123
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,360
and the setting for the story of Persephone.

124
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,460
Take us there, Thought Bubble.

125
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:28,700
Persephone was the daughter of the harvest goddess, Demeter, and supreme god, Zeus...

126
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,020
who were brother and sister (we'll get into all that weird incest stuff later)

127
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,540
and her original name was Kore, which can be translated as "girl."

128
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,860
One day, Kore was out picking flowers when she caught the eye of Zeus's brother, Hades,

129
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,980
who rode up from the underworld (also confusingly called Hades)

130
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,620
and kidnapped her to make her his wife...

131
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,740
and also probably raped her,

132
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,160
but again, we're gonna save the deeply uncomfortable sexual content for another episode

133
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,300
except for this brief mention right here. Sorry.

134
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,720
Kore was understandably... upset.

135
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:01,120
Demeter was full on enraged, and threatened to make all mankind starve,

136
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,260
so finally Zeus had to go and ask his brother to give Kore back.

137
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,800
In some versions of this myth, this was a problem for Zeus,

138
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,760
because he had promised Kore to his brother as a wife without telling Demeter first.

139
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:16,580
Hades was not a dumb guy, and before he let Kore go, he offered her a snack.

140
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,000
Kore had been warned to never eat anything in the underworld,

141
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,520
but she must've been extremely hungry by then,

142
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,680
and really, I mean, how much harm could six honey sweet pomegranate seeds really do?

143
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,460
Well, turns out, a lot.

144
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,179
In some versions, she eats them on purpose because she actually liked her husband.

145
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,019
In others, she's tricked into it.

146
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,580
Either way, even six seeds matter.

147
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:43,359
Kore has to remain in the underworld for six months out of the one month for each seed that she ate,

148
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,620
and will spend the other six months on Olympus with her parents.

149
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:52,100
During the six months in Olympus, Demeter would allow the fruits and grains to flourish.

150
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,960
The rest of the time, Demeter would mourn Kore, who had renamed herself Persephone,

151
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,080
and the ground would freeze, and nothing would grow...

152
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,880
and that is why we have winter.

153
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,680
Thanks thought bubble!

154
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,400
So, this is a story that is significant because of its explanatory power.

155
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,780
The fancy term for this is an "etiological narrative," or origin story.

156
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,500
The Persephone myth explains the seasons,

157
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,860
relating the cycle of planting and harvest

158
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,340
to the actions of the immortals.

159
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:25,900
For some mythologists, like E.B. Tylor, this story is an example of myth as primitive science.

160
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:30,560
Tylor and many other scientists drew a distinction between primitive people,

161
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,460
who used myths to explain the world in which they lived, and modern people, who use science for that purpose.

162
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,900
For Tylor, myth and science can't really be reconciled;

163
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:44,300
science has taken the place of myth, so we don't need myths anymore.

164
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:49,000
This is a pretty hard core theory, and since we like to view things complexly here at Crash Course,

165
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,560
we're not gonna subscribe to it, or any theory wholeheartedly.

166
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,740
But we are gonna introduce some of these theories to you,

167
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,380
so that you can make up your own mind.

168
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,380
Right now we're not gonna get too deep into the theory of myths--

169
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:04,620
mythography, if you wanna thrill your friends and impress people at parties,

170
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,700
because I want to tell you where the series is planning to go,

171
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,040
but also because there are a lot of theories to mythology,

172
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,080
and I don't want to include too many of them in this introduction.

173
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:19,580
As long time viewers know, it's easy to get lost in the weeds once we start talking about theory,

174
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:22,280
which is part of the reason we love theory so much.

175
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,080
And it's one of the reasons we have eight Sanskrit deities who are guardians of the right direction.

176
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,300
This series isn't going to be comprehensive.

177
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,680
We can't present everything there is to know about thousand year old stories

178
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,620
in four hundred odd minutes of video.

179
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,500
But we are gonna try to introduce you to some myths you might not know,

180
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,460
from places that you might be less familiar with.

181
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:47,340
This approach is gonna be comparative and thematic, rather than geographic.

182
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,160
Here's what we're planning:

183
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,640
The first theme we'll be covering is the most difficult:

184
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,760
Creation myths.

185
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,080
Most cultures have some story of how the world and the people in it came to be;

186
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,760
we're gonna spend a few weeks working through them.

187
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:03,500
Be forewarned, creation myths are often mysterious, the language can be tricky or obscure,

188
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,200
so expect a bit of confusion and a lot of interpretation...

189
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,260
also some turtles for a significant distance in the downward direction.

190
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,000
It's turtles all the way down.

191
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,060
After we see how the world and, sometimes, the universe was created,

192
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,200
we're gonna examine pantheons:

193
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,820
the groups of gods that feature in stories from different cultures, and how they function in those cultures.

194
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,780
And then we're gonna take a look at how the universe was destroyed--

195
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,440
looking at flood myths and the apocalypse.

196
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,280
Now, obviously this puts us in the realm of religion

197
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,920
and the potential for challenging people's belief systems is high.

198
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:42,900
Like we said earlier, we're gonna try to focus on the stories, and leave questions of truth and belief up to you.

199
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:48,440
In the second half of the series, we'll come down from Olympus and Valhalla and all those various mountains;

200
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,200
we're gonna do about ten episodes on heroes from all over the world,

201
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,800
which should be really fun, maybe even super.

202
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,820
See what I did there?

203
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:00,820
After heroes, we're gonna talk about mythical places and creatures and objects like winged sandals,

204
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,280
and we'll finish up with a few episodes on myths in the modern world,

205
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,800
which, for viewers of Crash Course Psychology and Literature, might sound a bit familiar.

206
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,340
So, that is the broad outline of this series.

207
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,880
We're really excited to be bringing this to you, really hope you enjoy it...

208
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,420
Will it become the stuff of legend?

209
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,480
Just ask Balder, Norse god of joy.

210
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,440
We'll see you next week.

211
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,700
Crash Course Mythology is filmed in the Chad & Stacey Emigholz studio in Indianapolis, Indiana

212
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,800
and is produced with the help of all these nice people.

213
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,780
