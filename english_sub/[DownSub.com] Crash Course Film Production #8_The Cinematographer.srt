1
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:05,390
Movies are made up of series of images.

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,390
Some are beautiful, some are harsh, and some
stick in our minds forever.

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:12,040
Like the gently rolling spaceships in 2001
A Space Odyssey.

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,170
Or Peter O’Toole riding out of the desert
in Lawrence of Arabia.

5
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:18,080
Or Darth Vader emerging from the smoke in
Star Wars.

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,289
But who actually takes these pictures?

7
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:24,089
If the director is the one who sets the vision
for the film, whose job is it to bring that

8
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:25,089
vision to life?

9
00:00:25,089 --> 00:00:28,230
That’s the person who puts the pictures
in motion pictures.

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,240
The cinematographer.

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:42,380
[Intro Music Plays]

12
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:47,120
Cinematographers must be artists, engineers,
photographers, and storytellers, all at once.

13
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,650
Sometimes you’ll hear the cinematographer
referred to as the director of photography

14
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:51,650
or “DP.”

15
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,450
But don’t be confused, it’s the same job.

16
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,140
In some parts of the world, they prefer one
title to the other, but generally speaking,

17
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,620
the two titles are interchangeable.

18
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,620
And no matter what they call themselves, their
basic job is to translate the director’s

19
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:06,140
vision into things like framing, lighting,
and camera movement, so that the film’s

20
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,140
story, emotions, and themes are conveyed visually.

21
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,210
A cinematographer must not only possess great
technical skills, but also understand the

22
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,180
fundamental narrative beats of the film, the
arc of the characters, and how the shots might

23
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,650
cut together in the editing room.

24
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:20,270
And the job begins long before the cameras
start to roll.

25
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:24,110
During pre-production, the cinematographer
assembles the camera department, plans shots

26
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,679
with the director, and determines any special
equipment that might be necessary for the

27
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:31,320
shoot – from cranes and dollies to steadicams
and special lenses.

28
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,609
They also help the director decide what kind
of film stock or digital cameras to use and

29
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:37,390
what the overall look of the film will be.

30
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:41,289
During production itself, the cinematographer
oversees the lighting and shooting of the

31
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:42,380
film, shot by shot.

32
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,520
This includes supervising the camera department
and working very closely with the lighting

33
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,520
department -- the head of which, you’ll
recall, is the gaffer.

34
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,329
Since pictures are technically just a record
of light bouncing off objects, the gaffer

35
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:55,140
is fundamental to achieving the images that
make up the film.

36
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,109
And when it comes to the lights themselves,
the cinematographer has a lot to choose from.

37
00:01:59,109 --> 00:02:03,740
For example, there are Fresnel lights, which
use special lenses called … Fresnel lenses

38
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,570
... to produce a wide, hard light that softens
at the edges.

39
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:11,300
Commonly used for stage lighting, these lights
can get very hot very quickly.

40
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,580
Fluorescent lights are much cooler and softer,
but they’re quite fragile, which matters

41
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,320
on a film set when the lights are being moved
around so frequently.

42
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,471
LED lights create very little heat and are
favored by a lot of independent and DIY cinematographers

43
00:02:23,471 --> 00:02:25,320
because they’re cheap and use less power.

44
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,610
However, the colors and shadows they cast
can be unreliable and difficult to match,

45
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,610
bulb to bulb.

46
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,670
Incandescent lights, meanwhile, generate a
lot of heat, but they generally give a warm,

47
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,580
yellow light that can be very appealing.

48
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:42,140
And then we have HMIs, or... this...

49
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,170
These are massive lights that give off an
enormous amount of heat.

50
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:48,260
They’re so bright that they’re often used
to simulate daylight.

51
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,360
As in, the sun.

52
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,620
So, that’s the hardware, but in addition
to choosing which of these lights should be

53
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,000
used, the cinematographer also has a say in
how they’re arranged.

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,230
The most basic style of lighting, used in
everything from formal interviews to fiction

55
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,420
films, is 3-point lighting.

56
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,060
You start with a key light, which is the brightest
light, often positioned so that it shines

57
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,190
most directly on the subject of the shot.

58
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:11,031
Then you add some fill light, which is a dimmer
and more diffuse light used to fill in the

59
00:03:11,031 --> 00:03:13,060
shadows created by the key light.

60
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,150
Finally, back light, which is usually brighter
than the fill light, shines from behind the

61
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,670
subject of the shot.

62
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,350
This creates a “halo” or “edge” of
light that outlines the subject and separates

63
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,350
it from the background.

64
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:27,120
One of the questions the cinematographer grapples
with is figuring out where the light is coming

65
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,880
from in the world of the film.

66
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,620
This will determine the direction, color,
intensity, and quality of light that illuminates

67
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,620
the shot.

68
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,080
Sometimes cinematographers will use practical
lights, which are light sources you can actually

69
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,600
see in the shot, like desk lamps or windows.

70
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,100
Other times they’ll deliberately use artificial
lights, or even turn to a more radical strategy

71
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,210
to light their films.

72
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:49,540
Cinematographers Néstor Almendros and Haskell
Wexler famously shot Terrence Malick’s Days

73
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,930
of Heaven using natural sunlight, mostly that
brief period of the day immediately before

74
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,750
sunset, often called magic hour.

75
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:00,330
While working on Catch-22, David Watkin said,
“I’m going to do something rather daring.

76
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:03,720
I’m going to light the actors with only
explosions.”

77
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,720
And he did!

78
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,910
Cinematographer Ellen Kuras relied on a unique
combination of practical and artificial lights

79
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:12,320
to create the unusual transitions and effects
of Jim Carrey’s memory loss in Eternal Sunshine

80
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,320
of the Spotless Mind.

81
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,790
Malik Hassan Sayeed is a master of style,
shooting everything from Spike Lee’s He

82
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,070
Got Game to Beyoncé’s Lemonade.

83
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,080
When Gordon Willis decided to light The Godfather
in such a way that Marlon Brando’s eyes

84
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,400
would often be in shadow, it was seen as a
risky and daring strategy.

85
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,450
Cinematographers were supposed to light
a character’s eyes.

86
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,270
That’s just how it was done!

87
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:37,160
Instead, Willis chose to use this lighting
“mistake” to illustrate the dark and unknowable

88
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,530
soul of Don Corleone.

89
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,470
Now, the cinematographer also works closely
with the production designer, who’s the

90
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,470
head of the art department.

91
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:47,810
The production designer is in charge of carrying
out the whole look of the film, particularly

92
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:52,980
the physical elements like sets, costumes,
props, hair and makeup, but also non-physical

93
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,980
elements like computer-generated images and
how they interact with the physical objects

94
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,980
on camera.

95
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,320
The cinematographer and production designer
work closely on everything from the color

96
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,050
scheme of a set to how reflective its walls
should be.

97
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:08,540
And for sure, in addition to the lighting,
cinematographers have to consider all kinds

98
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,450
of factors when setting up their shots.

99
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:14,340
Not only do the shots need to cut together
to tell the story, but they’re often constructed

100
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,440
to have a beginning, middle, and end all their
own.

101
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,480
The director and cinematographer must decide
how much of the frame should be in focus,

102
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,730
using lens choice, film
stock, and aperture.

103
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,880
Related to that, the cinematographer has to
think about what’s featured in the foreground,

104
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,430
middle ground, and background of the shot.

105
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:32,790
The arrangement of these features within the
frame can have a profound impact on the audience.

106
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:37,000
Color and contrast also fall within the cinematographer’s
aesthetic toolkit.

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,130
Color can be used to draw our eye to or away
from one part of the frame, make narrative

108
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,050
or thematic links, or – as in The Wizard
of Oz – transport us to an entirely new

109
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,050
place!

110
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,820
Contrast, which refers to the ratio of the
darkest parts of the image to the lightest

111
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,050
parts, can perform many of the same functions.

112
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:57,500
Before there was color in film, contrast was
a particularly powerful tool for cinematographers.

113
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,860
Noir classics like Carol Reed’s The Third
Man use deep, dark shadows cut by bright shafts

114
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,440
of light to convey a sense of mystery and
menace .

115
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,960
Cinematographers might also decide to move the camera to evoke a particular feeling or

116
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,240
psychological effect.

117
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,940
This movement might be as simple as a pan
or a tilt to follow the action, or as involved

118
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,419
as Citizen Kane’s dramatic crane shot in
through the top of a nightclub.

119
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:24,200
Moving the camera in toward a character can
convey a variety of emotions, from fear closing

120
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,590
in on them, to some kind of internal revelation.

121
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:30,190
There are some pretty entertaining supercuts
of push-in shots on YouTube.

122
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,850
It makes you realize this technique is used
everywhere.

123
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,960
Now, what happens after the film is in the
can?

124
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,700
The job’s over, right?

125
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,700
Of course not.

126
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,610
The cinematographer is heavily involved in
a film’s post-production, too, because

127
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:47,090
the editing process offers a lots of opportunities
to manipulate the images that have been captured.

128
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,990
If a movie’s been shot on film, there are
all kinds of options to change color or exposure

129
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,830
by altering chemicals and timing, as the exposed
negative is developed and processed.

130
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,860
But whether the film was shot using traditional
film stock or a digital process, most feature

131
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,639
films are digitized at some point, to make
the editing easier.

132
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:05,979
And once the images have been converted into
digital information, even more options open

133
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:07,370
up for manipulating the footage.

134
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:11,680
Filters on photo apps like Instagram give
you some idea of how drastically you can change

135
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,520
a digital image after it’s been shot.

136
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,820
In order to maintain the look of the film,
the cinematographer is almost always deeply

137
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:22,380
engaged in this process, working hand in hand
with the director, the editor, the post-production

138
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,650
supervisor who’s overseeing this phase of
the process, and the special effects department.

139
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,120
So, yeah, it’s kind of a big job!

140
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:33,180
There’s a fantastic documentary called Visions
of Light that traces this history and art

141
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,180
of cinematography.

142
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,120
It’s out of print, but if you can find a
copy of it, you can hear some of the original

143
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,760
masters of the medium share their stories
and see examples of their work.

144
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,210
As with much of film production, there are
guidelines and customs when it comes to cinematography,

145
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,520
but no actual rules.

146
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,150
The right style of lighting or camera movement
for one film will be completely wrong for

147
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,150
another.

148
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:55,230
It’s up to the cinematographer to work with
the director to realize their vision for the

149
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:59,120
film, translating int into images that will
cut together to tell the story.

150
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,570
Today we learned about the multi-faceted job
of the cinematographer.

151
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,610
We covered the various roles of the camera
and lighting departments and how they work

152
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,919
together to realize a director’s vision.

153
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,650
And we considered some of the tools and strategies
available to the cinematographer.

154
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:16,040
Next time we’ll look at the fascinating
on-set work of set designers, costume designers,

155
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,290
and special effects make-up!

156
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:21,419
Crash Course Film Production is produced in
association with PBS Digital Studios.
