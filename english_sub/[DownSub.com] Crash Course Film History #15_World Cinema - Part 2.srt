1
00:00:03,159 --> 00:00:07,379
Films can be a lot of things: A form of mass
communication; a means of personal expression;

2
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:10,889
or a business, big or small… depending on
how many superheroes you cram into one movie.

3
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:14,349
But films can also create, clarify, or reinforce
a national identity.

4
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:18,250
In many places outside of the United States
and Europe, cinema arrived relatively late,

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,430
and often at a time of political upheaval.

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,080
Filmmakers used their movies to tell their
own stories and establish new, collective identities.

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,240
Although the industries of Africa, South America,
and the Middle East relatively small,

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,880
these films and filmmakers are
vitally important both to local audiences

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,880
and to the diversity of world cinema.

[Opening Music Plays]

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,840
African cinema is generally divided between

12
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,780
North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa.

13
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:53,899
The biggest film producer in North Africa
is Egypt, and Egyptian cinema has dominated

14
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:55,260
the Arab world for decades.

15
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,900
Egyptian cinema’s “golden age” ran from
the 1940s to the 1960s.

16
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,670
In this era, the studios produced Hollywood-style
genre movies and prestige dramas.

17
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,780
In 1952, the Egyptian monarchy was overthrown,
and a new military regime was ushered in by

18
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,430
a charismatic leader, Gamal Abdel
Nasser.

19
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:15,140
Nasser’s government nationalized the film
industry in 1966 and began exercising significant

20
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,030
control over what movies got made.

21
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:21,100
Many filmmakers felt stifled, unable to produce
films even vaguely critical of the current regime.

22
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:25,080
But Egyptian filmmakers still found ways to
produce classics at the time, from Al Haram

23
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,450
by Henry Barakat to Shadi Abdel Salam’s
The Night of Counting the Years.

24
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:32,490
In the 1970s, Egyptian cinema began to find
a balance between politics and entertainment.

25
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,720
And during this time, their first internationally-recognized
director emerged.

26
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,330
Youssef Chahine was born
in 1926.

27
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:41,840
After college, he convinced his parents to
send him to Hollywood to study acting.

28
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,780
He then returned to Egypt and directed his
first feature film at just 23, a movie called

29
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,420
Daddy Amin... who said actors can't direct?

30
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,060
His second film, Nile Boy, was invited to
the prestigious Cannes Film Festival.

31
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,979
And his third, The Blazing Sun, introduced
the world to Omar Sharif, an actor who would

32
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,690
go on to international stardom in English
language films like Lawrence of Arabia and

33
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:00,690
Doctor Zhivago.

34
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:05,740
But Chahine’s major achievement was an autobiographical trilogy, made between 1978 and 1990,

35
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,729
which traced the social history of modern Egypt.

36
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:11,980
In the 1980s, as government censors relaxed
a bit, several women directors graduated from

37
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:16,000
the Egyptian Film Institute and began making
movies with explicitly feminist themes.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,050
This marked a new and vital phase of Egyptian
production, as Asmaa El-Bakry directed

39
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,240
1991’s Beggars and Proud Ones
and Inas Al-Degheidy

40
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,840
released Lady Killers the following year.

41
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,030
The Gulf War in 1991 and the emergence of
satellite television brought the Egyptian

42
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,700
film industry to a near-standstill.

43
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:35,060
But by the mid-2000s, domestic production
had rebounded and continues to thrive to this day.

44
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,200
Algeria is home to another significant North
African film industry.

45
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:42,340
After a vicious war and winning their independence
from France in 1962, Algerian movies were

46
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,710
mostly what they called “freedom-fighter
cinema.”

47
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,340
These were films about the struggle to escape
colonial rule.

48
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,160
It wasn’t until the 1970s, however, that
an Algerian film broke out onto the world stage.

49
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,320
Mohammed Lakdar-Hamima’s Chronicle of the
Years of Fire depicted one family’s epic

50
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,120
journey through the end of the colonial period.

51
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,560
The film won the Grand Prix at the Cannes
Film Festival in 1975.

52
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,420
Beginning in 1992, a militant Islamic insurgency
took root in Algeria, and the ensuing violence

53
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,319
has forced most Algerian filmmakers to live
and work abroad.

54
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,740
Many contemporary films focus on characters
that have left Algeria and struggle with their

55
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,240
identities as expatriates.

56
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,740
Rachid Bouchareb’s 2010 film Outside the Law, for instance, deals

57
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:21,900
with three Algerian brothers living in France
between 1945 and 1962, during the Algerian

58
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,900
war for independence.

59
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,740
Now, one notable film-producing country in
sub-Saharan Africa is Senegal, another former

60
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,740
French colony.

61
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,740
And the undisputed father of Senegalese film
is Ousmane Sembène.

62
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,760
A veteran of World War II, Sembène moved

63
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,150
to France in 1947 and experienced racism while
working in a car factory and at the shipping

64
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,650
port of Marseille. He turned these experiences into his first

65
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,420
French-language novel, The Black Docker, in
1956.

66
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,560
And he would return time and again to themes
of isolation, persecution, and loss of identity

67
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,560
in his films.

68
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,290
After studying filmmaking in the Soviet Union,
Sembène returned to Senegal to make a twenty-minute

69
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:56,680
short called Borom Sarret in 1963, commonly
considered the first indigenous black African film.

70
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,680
Sembène’s next film, Black Girl, stands
as one of the first anti-colonial films to

71
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,260
come out of Africa and gain international
recognition.

72
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,840
The story follows a young Senegalese woman
working as a nanny for a French family in

73
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,420
the capital city of Dakar.

74
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,670
After accepting an offer to return to France
with them, she finds herself disrespected

75
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,540
and abused, surrounded by a culture that refuses
to accept her.

76
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,519
And at the end of the film, her story ends
in tragedy.

77
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,430
Sembène would go on to make films right up
to his death in 2007, wrestling with complex

78
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,770
issues of identity and culture in colonial
and post-colonial Africa.

79
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,250
Other African countries have their own vibrant
filmmaking traditions.

80
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:31,220
Angola established a film school in 1977,
two years after it won independence from Portugal.

81
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,320
The country of Burkina Faso is home to the
Pan-African Festival of Cinema and Television,

82
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,470
the largest African film event in the world.

83
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:41,240
And Nigeria has a vital film culture with
its own star system, making it the third most

84
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,800
valuable film industry in the world.

85
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,650
Now, another region that boasts a long history
of post-colonial and indigenous cinema is

86
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,650
Latin America.

87
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,740
Although many Latin American film industries
have been dominated by films from the United

88
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,400
States, Cuba and Brazil have maintained some
autonomy.

89
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,650
Cuba produced about 150 feature films prior
to the Cuban Revolution in 1959.

90
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:01,220
But almost immediately after Fidel Castro
took over, the film industry became an arm

91
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,220
of his government.

92
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,889
He founded a national film institute and commissioned
films through the National Board of Culture.

93
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,840
Like many leaders before him, Castro understood
the power cinema had to influence masses of

94
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,940
people, many of whom were poor and illiterate.

95
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,960
Most established filmmakers fled or were pushed
out, so the revolutionary era of Cuban cinema

96
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,710
began with a handful of people with little
filmmaking experience and some old equipment.

97
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:24,060
Over the next two decades, they would produce
over 100 feature films, 900 documentary shorts,

98
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,020
and 1,300 weekly newsreels. That's a lot of content!

99
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,270
By the 1970s, Cuban cinema’s infrastructure
of domestic production and distribution were

100
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,680
in place, and the films got more sophisticated.

101
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,370
Genres and styles multiplied, encompassing everything from Sergio Giral’s experimental Marxist work The Other
Francisco,

102
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:43,900
to Sara Gómez’s One Way or Another, a fusion of Hollywood style and avant-garde social critique.

103
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,020
But the 1990s hit Cuban cinema hard.

104
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,890
With the fall of communism in Europe, Castro’s
government had few allies besides China and

105
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:50,890
North Korea.

106
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:54,460
Movie production fell off a cliff, dropping
from about 10 feature films per year to just

107
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,460
two or three.

108
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:59,000
And political repression got worse, so many
filmmakers left the country to live in exile

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,180
throughout Latin America.

110
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,001
Eventually, a combination of factors led to
a resurgence of film production in Cuba: like

111
00:06:04,001 --> 00:06:07,790
digital technology making production less
expensive, coupled with relaxing tensions

112
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:08,790
with the United States.

113
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:12,110
Now, the other major Latin American film industry
hails from Brazil.

114
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,940
In 1924, the majority of films screened in
Brazil came from Hollywood, like the rest

115
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,940
of Latin America.

116
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,550
President Getùlio Vargas tried to end the
dominance of Hollywood cinema by establishing

117
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:24,840
quotas for local film production in 1932,
which continued into the 1950s.

118
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,840
But that didn’t do much.

119
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,960
The highly charged political atmosphere of
the 1960s was the real catalyst for change.

120
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,590
Inspired by the aesthetic of the Italian Neo-Realists
and the low-budget filmmaking techniques of

121
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:38,240
the French New Wave, a group of Brazilian
filmmakers created cinema novo or new cinema.

122
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,900
The cinema novo directors made films that
deliberately subverted the norms of classical

123
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,560
narrative cinema, in direct response to what
they saw as the colonization of Brazilian

124
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,690
cinema by Hollywood.

125
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:51,090
The group’s unofficial leader, Glauber Rocha,
made Black God, White Devil in 1964.

126
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:54,840
It’s about a poor ranch hand who’s cheated
out of his wages, kills his boss, and goes

127
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,630
on the run with his wife and a violent, apocalyptic
preacher.

128
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,990
There’s a fearlessness to the film, and
a rejection of a traditional moral code.

129
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,810
Nelson Pereira dos Santos made Barren Lives in 1963, another

130
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:08,770
key film in the early cinema novo movement,
and one invited to the Cannes Film Festival.

131
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:12,400
His film tells the story of an impoverished
family trying to survive in Brazil’s drought-ridden

132
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,509
northeastern plain.

133
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:17,229
This focus on low-budget productions that
examine the socio-political landscape caught

134
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:19,320
on in other Latin American countries.

135
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,820
Indigenous filmmakers found inspiration to
tell their stories without relying on traditional

136
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,180
film studios or government assistance.

137
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,430
And while their films might not screen much
internationally, filmmakers from Argentina

138
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:34,070
and Chile to Colombia and Peru have used this
model to forge their own cinematic identities.

139
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,670
Now, one of the major players in Middle
Eastern cinema is Iran, whose domestic market

140
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:42,180
was also dominated by U.S. movies for years,
until the Iranian Revolution in 1979.

141
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,540
The first Iranian-produced film to break out
internationally was Dariush Mehrjui’s

142
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:50,419
1969 film The Cow, telling the story
of a rural villager whose prized cow dies.

143
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:53,400
Mehrjui’s film was banned by the pre-revolutionary
Iranian government.

144
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,820
They wanted films that would project a modern
image to the rest of the world, not ones that

145
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,830
examined the day-to-day life of the downtrodden.

146
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:02,980
Nevertheless, The Cow went on to win top prizes
at the Chicago and Venice Film Festivals and

147
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,960
set the template for the Iranian New Wave.

148
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,639
Much like the French New Wave and Brazil’s
cinema novo, the Iranian New Wave produced

149
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,980
films that explored the lives of ordinary
people, especially those facing hardship and persecution.

150
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,960
After the Revolution, the government of Ayatollah Khomeini

151
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:20,139
exercised strict theocratic censorship over
Iranian film, decimating production and prompting

152
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:22,330
many established filmmakers to flee the country.

153
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:26,370
The Iranian film industry finally began to
recover in the 1990s, as filmmakers fell into

154
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:30,210
two main camps: the “populist cinema”
that made commercial entertainment; and the

155
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,190
“art cinema” that produced more personal,
esoteric films.

156
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:37,469
One of the major figures of recent Iranian
cinema is Abbas Kiarostami, whose film A Taste

157
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:40,559
of Cherry won the top prize at the Cannes
Film Festival in 1997.

158
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,829
Mohsen Makhmalbaf’s 2001
film Kandahar made a Time magazine list of

159
00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:46,649
the top 100 movies of all time.

160
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:49,829
And Asghar Farhadi has
won two Best Foreign Language Oscars for his

161
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:54,689
elliptical domestic mysteries: A Separation
from 2011, and The Salesman from 2016.

162
00:08:54,689 --> 00:08:58,730
So although post-Revolution Iranian cinema
took a while to achieve serious global recognition,

163
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:03,500
it has since emerged as a narrative and stylistic
innovator on the world cinema stage, influencing

164
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,290
filmmakers and inspiring filmgoers around
the globe.

165
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:10,139
Today we explored more world cinema, beginning
with the post-colonial cinema of Africa.

166
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:14,179
We talked about the development of Latin American
cinema through the lens of Cuba and Brazil.

167
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:18,850
And we touched on the vital filmmaking tradition
of Iran established during the last 25 years.

168
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,990
Next time, we’ll jump into the strange and
exciting world of experimental and documentary filmmaking.

169
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,570
It's gonna get weird... and real!

170
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,879
Crash Course Film History is produced in association
with PBS Digital Studios.

174
00:09:39,269 --> 00:00:00,000
