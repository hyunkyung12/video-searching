1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,910
While it’s easy to love a straight-up superhero
movie or car chase flick, not all films fit

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,200
neatly into one genre.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,260
Take the Alien series, for instance.

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:15,130
You’ve got some sci-fi thriller movies with
action and horror elements thrown in.

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:20,540
And, not to mention, a protagonist who arguably
helped pioneer the trope of a “strong female character.”

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,700
In this episode, we’re gonna focus on the
second film in the series, James Cameron’s

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,840
Aliens—the theatrical cut, not the extended
special edition.

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,000
With its carefully-crafted plot points and
ensemble cast of characters, this sci-fi action

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,630
classic rewards a deeper look.

10
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,810
On the one hand, you can think about Aliens
as a war movie, and unpack the battle between

11
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,510
human Marines and vicious aliens through a
racial and cultural lens.

12
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,969
Whether or not that’s what Cameron intended.

13
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:46,190
Or you can look at it as an action movie,
and analyze Ellen Ripley as a hero through

14
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:47,359
a feminist lens.

15
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,230
Because her character is part of what’s
really special about this film, both for fans

16
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,469
and historically in cinema.

17
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:55,500
I’m Michael Aranda, and this is Crash Course
Film Criticism.

18
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:07,740
[intro music plays]

19
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:15,540
The original Alien came out in 1979. Directed by Ridley Scott, it’s slow, methodical, and spooky—a horror movie in space.

20
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,540
Whereas Aliens is a different kind of film—an
intense war movie… in space.

21
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,940
Alien starred Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley,
a space trucker whose crew responds to a distress

22
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:30,260
call that brings them to LV-426, a desolate
planet with an alien life form that incubates

23
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,420
inside humans.

24
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:36,170
Through her smarts and tenacity, Ripley survives,
blows the alien into space, and seals herself

25
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,540
into a hypersleep pod with her cat, Jones.

26
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:43,030
Because Alien straddles the science fiction
and horror genres, Ripley’s sort of a combination

27
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:46,660
of an action hero and the “final girl”
movie trope.

28
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,900
The term “final girl” was first used by
the film scholar Carol J. Clover to describe

29
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,280
a pattern in slasher movies.

30
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,360
A typically-virginal woman tends to be the
only survivor of a killer’s murdering spree,

31
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,210
fights them, and lives to tell the story.

32
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,830
And James Cameron’s Aliens picks up her
story later…

33
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,150
57 years later.

34
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,810
Ripley is found by a salvage ship and brought
back to a Gateway station near Earth.

35
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,419
She has to defend herself in a room full of
suits for destroying a ship while fighting

36
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:11,760
an alien she can’t prove existed, which
doesn’t go well.

37
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,320
Ripley: But I'm telling you that those things exist.

38
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,120
Van Luen:  Thank you Officer Ripley, that will be all.

39
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,500
Ripley: Please, you're not listening to me.

40
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,520
So she gets demoted and is forced to work
in a loading dock.

41
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,500
Eventually The Weyland-Yutani Corporation,
a sinister conglomerate also known as The

42
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,940
Company, asks her to be a consultant on a
military expedition that’s being sent back to LV-426.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,480
Now there’s a colony there that—surprise—they’ve
lost contact with.

44
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:38,819
Suffering from PTSD, Ripley rejects their
request, following the pattern of most characters

45
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:39,959
on a hero’s journey.

46
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,760
But she eventually agrees to go back, feeling
a special duty to protect any survivors and

47
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,900
eradicate the aliens, an enemy no one knows
better than she does.

48
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:58,920
Ripley: Just tell me one thing, Burke. You're going out there to destroy them, right? Not to study... not to bring back.

49
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,340
...but to wipe them out.

50
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:07,320
Burke: That's the plan. You have my word on it.

51
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,380
Ripley: All right, I'm in.

52
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:13,260
These become the two instincts that most define
her as a character: the drive to protect and

53
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:14,379
the duty to kill.

54
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:17,989
The basic plot is similar to the original
film: the aliens get loose, people run, and

55
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:21,159
most of the Marines die in a lopsided fight
early in the film’s second act.

56
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:25,219
But after an intense battle with the alien
queen, Ripley survives, along with her found

57
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:29,579
family: a surrogate daughter named Newt who’s
the only surviving colonist, a Corporal named

58
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:31,629
Hicks, and an android named Bishop.

59
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:34,419
The plot of Aliens came from the brain of
James Cameron.

60
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:38,139
He was given the opportunity to write a treatment
by 20th Century Fox producers David Giler

61
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,900
and Walter Hill on the strength of his original
Terminator script.

62
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,319
His treatment hit every note they hoped for
in a sequel, so he was given 18 million dollars

63
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,980
and sent to Pinewood Studios in England to
make it.

64
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,469
The British film crew buckled under Cameron’s
exhaustive shooting schedule and inexperience.

65
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:57,090
Cameron had guerrilla filmmaking expectations,
where 12 hour days were normal to finish projects

66
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,390
on time and under budget.

67
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,370
The 1st A.D. even led a revolt against Cameron
that was eventually put down by Producer Gale

68
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,969
Ann Hurd and effects guru Stan Winston.

69
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:10,269
After the movie was finished, it had massive
success, with a worldwide gross of 130 million

70
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:13,109
dollars off of an 18 million dollar initial
investment.

71
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:17,798
Plus, the awards and accolades piled up, from
Oscar nominations to wins for visual effects

72
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:19,179
and sound effect editing.

73
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,620
Aliens is now considered a seminal classic
in sci-fi, horror, and 80s pop culture.

74
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,610
Its structure and themes are incredibly effective
and stand the test of time.

75
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,530
You can look at the original Alien as a haunted
house film set on a spaceship.

76
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:35,900
Ripley was the lone survivor after her companions
were picked off one-by-one by a horrific alien

77
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,900
monster.

78
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,683
The same as any Halloween or Friday the 13th
film, really.

79
00:04:39,683 --> 00:04:41,910
But Aliens takes the basic elements in a different
direction.

80
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:45,949
It’s more of an action or war movie, where
a squad of marines is pitted against a squad

81
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:46,949
of aliens.

82
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:51,180
Roger Ebert wrote of Aliens in his 1986 review,
“...when I walked out of the theater, there

83
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,590
were knots in my stomach from the film's roller-coaster
ride of violence.”

84
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,590
He gave it a “Thumbs Up” but also couldn’t
really recommend it.

85
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,870
So it’s intense, at least for 1986.

86
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:03,060
Cameron has said that the marines in this
film were meant to parallel a group of American

87
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,229
Army soldiers toward the end of their tour
in the Vietnam era.

88
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:08,870
He wanted to make it feel like a gritty, realistic
expedition.

89
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:12,259
With a fairly tight budget, he used story
elements like the beeping motion-tracker to

90
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:13,310
build tension.

91
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,590
Like the shark in Jaws, sometimes not seeing
the monster is even scarier.

92
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,260
It’s classic horror storytelling!

93
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,320
Hudson: Six!
Ripley: That can't be that's inside the room!

94
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,880
Hudson: It's readin' right, man. Look!

95
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,220
Not to mention, he didn’t have to spend
money he didn’t have on huge swarms of alien creatures.

96
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,639
Cameron also says he was trying to show how
cockiness and over-reliance on technology

97
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,240
can bring about the downfall of large military
institutions.

98
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,540
And it’s true that his space Marines are
basically a tool of The Company, and don’t

99
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,540
come off so well.

100
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,669
He mentions how Americans’ advanced weapons
didn’t matter in the Vietnam war, because

101
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:47,360
they didn’t understand how to fight their
low-tech but very stealthy and determined enemy.

102
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,280
But, whether or not Cameron intended this,
painting both military adversaries and other

103
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:54,550
races as savage aliens is not uncommon in
media.

104
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,310
Especially when you look at texts through
a cultural or racial critical lens.

105
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,939
There are lots of examples of narrative fiction
where aliens are described as faceless, dangerous

106
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:04,030
enemies that are pitted against our usually
white, Western-coded heroes.

107
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,610
During the Cold War, for instance, alien invasion
was a common plot point in sci-fi and horror

108
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:09,720
in the United States.

109
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,009
Think of films like The Invasion of the Body
Snatchers, which really struck a nerve at

110
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:14,009
the time.

111
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:18,000
People were afraid of foreign invaders sneaking
into our society, attacking us, and robbing

112
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,889
us of our identities and way of life.

113
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:22,389
Other aliens in fiction are much more primitive
than humans.

114
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:26,570
Think of A Princess of Mars, which was adapted
into the film John Carter, or even James Cameron’s

115
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,759
later film, Avatar.

116
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,950
These aliens can be seen as stereotypical
portrayals of non-white racial others, especially

117
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,120
native peoples.

118
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,470
And they usually either end up fighting the
heroes or depending on them to swoop in and

119
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,190
save their troubled societies.

120
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:42,200
So, by one interpretation, Cameron’s choice
to compare his vicious aliens to the Vietnamese

121
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,910
army makes this another film that parallels
xenophobia in the real world.

122
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:49,629
And even though his main intent was to criticize
The Company, and he might not have been trying

123
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:53,250
to make a racial commentary, it’s definitely
worth looking at the way Aliens and many other

124
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,009
sci-fi and horror stories portray alien enemies.

125
00:06:56,009 --> 00:07:00,280
Now, despite Aliens being a gritty war movie,
the camaraderie and one-liners from the Marines

126
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,480
are part of what make the film so memorable
and entertaining.

127
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,380
Hudson: Man, get it on!!! You know it!!!

128
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,840
And another huge part of that is the setups
and payoffs in the screenplay.

129
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,470
You can think of Aliens as a series of well-crafted
chain reactions.

130
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:16,979
A leads to B which leads to C. There’s always
a reason for what’s happening on screen.

131
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,919
By today’s standards, these plot points
might be a little obvious.

132
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,230
But by planting ideas that will come back
around, Cameron lets us anticipate and appreciate

133
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,190
his cohesive vision for the story.

134
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:30,569
For instance, because the compound is basically
a big bomb, the Marines dump all their high-tech

135
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:34,759
bullets into Private Frost’s bag and are
told to only use flamethrowers.

136
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:39,900
But when the aliens attack, Frost is accidentally
set on fire and the satchel explodes, killing

137
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,069
another marine and leaving the survivors with
very little ammo.

138
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:46,469
Or like when Farrow, the pilot, doesn’t
let her co-pilot explain that something’s

139
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:47,469
wrong.

140
00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:50,530
Then an alien gets on board and kills her,
so the drop ship crashes.

141
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:55,229
This strands our heroes, damages the compound—which is a big bomb, as we already know—and forces

142
00:07:55,229 --> 00:07:58,330
a ticking clock that motivates everyone for
the rest of the film.

143
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:02,569
Overall, a lot of Cameron’s setups and payoffs
work to build up Ellen Ripley’s character,

144
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:04,110
especially her humanity and heroism.

145
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:08,230
She’s at the heart of the film, and at the
heart of her story is love, which is one

146
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:11,110
of Cameron’s self-proclaimed favorite themes
to explore.

147
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,439
And that’s really unusual for an action
movie.

148
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:17,530
Like, lots of action-packed stories revolve
around traditionally masculine ideals.

149
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,870
There are beefy cars and gearheads in films
like The Fast and the Furious, or brooding

150
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,620
old men in movies like Logan.

151
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,960
Things like anger, vengeance, or power tend
to be at the center of conflicts.

152
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,370
Now, in the Alien series, power is still a
major theme.

153
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:33,409
But, partially because these movies ultimately
focus on a female hero, it’s interesting

154
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:35,649
to unpack them through a feminist critical
lens.

155
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:39,820
There have been countless essays written about
 the Alien frankchise from this critical perspective, like

156
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,770
how the aliens could represent fears of sexual
power, rape, or female reproduction.

157
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:47,040
One of the most horrifying parts of these
movies is also what Ripley has nightmares

158
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,300
about: humans are violated and essentially
become pregnant with aliens, which ultimately

159
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,300
kill them.

160
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:57,050
Like, the facehugger aliens implant babies
into human chests, which incubate and burst

161
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,200
out in bloody explosions.

162
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,200
Plus…

163
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,620
I mean… it’s a penis.

164
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,620
Just look at it.

165
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,350
So throughout the first film, Ripley can be
seen as a version of the maiden archetype,

166
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,029
a damsel-in-distress running from a horrible
monster.

167
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:11,320
She fits right into the “final girl” movie
trope, where the last woman standing goes

168
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,579
from helpless victim to defeating the murderer.

169
00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:18,850
By the time Aliens happens, Ripley is a traumatized
action hero, who is haunted by alien implantation

170
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,840
and chest-bursting gore—a very specific
kind of violence.

171
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,860
A sense of duty compels her to return to LV-426
and fight the aliens.

172
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,300
But when she discovers Newt on the base, protectiveness
becomes an even bigger motivator.

173
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,810
You immediately get the sense that Newt becomes
her surrogate daughter, and that the force

174
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,720
of motherly love is powerful.

175
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,850
It compels Ripley to survive in the compound
and fight off the aliens, not only for herself

176
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:42,029
and for the Marines, but for this young girl.

177
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:46,680
So, in a way, Ripley transitions from the
maiden archetype in Alien to the mother archetype

178
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,880
in Aliens.

179
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,389
Her character is allowed to be feminine, and
embrace the idea of motherhood and family,

180
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:55,660
but she’s not excessively weak or emotional,
or made to be the butt of a joke.

181
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:00,740
This perfectly sets up Ripley and the alien
queen in direct conflict: two mothers are

182
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,370
both protective of their children, and they’re
locked in combat because their goals are in

183
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,370
opposition.

184
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:08,110
That’s very basic, but also very effective
screenwriting.

185
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:11,730
And it leads us to one of the ultimate payoffs
of the film: Ripley getting into the power

186
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,440
loader suit to fight off the queen.

187
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,960
This is Cameron planting the seeds for the
climax of the movie, when Ripley’s skill

188
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,540
is the key to protecting her newfound family—Newt,
and an injured Corporal Hicks.

189
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,880
As Ripley yells...

190
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,900
Ripley: Get away from her you *JERK*!!!

191
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,600
we’re all cheering for her and the strength of motherly love.

192
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,529
And audiences weren’t the only ones cheering.

193
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:36,060
Sigourney Weaver was nominated for the 1987
Oscar for Best Actress for this role—an

194
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,840
honor that hadn’t been given to an action
movie heroine before.

195
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,320
And it was for a protagonist motivated by
love for her found family.

196
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,910
So you’ve got to give Aliens some credit,
whether you appreciate it as a well-constructed

197
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:50,110
sci-fi classic or for Ellen Ripley’s impact
on female heroes in decades to come.

198
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,839
But it’s also a great example of using film
criticism to look at genre-transcending stories

199
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,690
in multiple ways, which directors may or may
not have intended.

200
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:02,829
Next time, we’ll talk about the critically-acclaimed
Selma, a historical drama film about the life

201
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:07,190
of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and the role
that media can play in shaping our idea of

202
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,100
what actually happened in 
the past.

203
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:16,580
