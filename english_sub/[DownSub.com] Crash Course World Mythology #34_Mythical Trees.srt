00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
Hey there I'm Mike Rugnetta, this is Crash Course Mythology and today

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,849
We're continuing our round-the-world tour of mythical features of the natural world. Today we behold

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:15,020
trees and yes technically trees do appear in gardens like the ones in the Garden of Eden

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,660
but trees have a mythological richness all their own

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,120
Also they're so nice and shady they deserve an episode all to themselves. Right Thoth ?

6
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:27,179
He's so tranquil. Don't worry. We'll fix that

7
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:41,180
So, if you've been watching this series closely you'll remember some of the trees we've already met,

8
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:45,360
like the tree of knowledge of good and evil from Eden that was the one tree

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,460
Yahweh told Adam and Eve not to eat from.

10
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,780
And then they did. It's the one that hosted a serpent which told Eve to eat the knowledge Apple

11
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:59,300
- which might have actually been a quince or a fig or a pomegranate - and which filled Eve and Adam both with the knowledge

12
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,340
that they were naked. As you may recall that didn't work out well

13
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,620
and it's the reason we now have pain in childbirth and infinite weeding.

14
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,120
But the tree of knowledge is hardly the only

15
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:16,180
mythically significant tree. We've also met Yggdrasil and we're about to encounter Aswatha, two trees which contain the whole of

16
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,400
cosmology in their roots and branches

17
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:25,300
We've talked a bit before about Yggdrasil, the great ash tree where Odin hangs himself to learn the secret of runes

18
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:29,469
Between the tips of its branches and its roots exists the entire

19
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,990
Cosmos, from the beginning to the end of time Yggdrasil has three

20
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:40,260
Great roots one reaching to Asgard where the æsir and white elves live one to Jotunheim

21
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:48,009
the home of men, dark elves, dwarves and giants and the last to Niffleheim where hell the person rules over the land of the

22
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:52,560
dead hell the place. Yggdrasil is both a tree of knowledge and a tree of life

23
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,860
connecting and sustaining all the plains of the Norse universe. It's foretold to be one of the few things to survive

24
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,460
Ragnarok and from its bark

25
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,490
mankind will be renewed

26
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:13,000
Fittingly, Yggdrasil teams with life and activity. On its top branches lives an eagle and on top of that eagle a hawk.

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,280
Down at the base of the tree lives Nidhogg (Níðhǫggr) a

28
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:23,259
Dragon who gnaws on the roots of the tree and baddies on their way to hell. A naughty squirrel named Ratatosk lives among the branches

29
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:31,660
Carrying insults back and forth between the eagle and the dragon making them even more insulting along the way. Indian mythology also

30
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:37,500
Features a tree that represents the entire cosmos in the Vedas and the Upanishads we find a giant

31
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,920
Inverted tree whose roots reached to the sky and whose branches covered the earth

32
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,469
This cosmic tree Aswatha often called a Bodhi tree

33
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,789
represents Brahma the supreme a cosmic spirit in full and

34
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:56,169
Glorious bloom. Aswatha is further described in the Mahabharata which explains

35
00:02:56,689 --> 00:03:02,828
"Sprung from the unmanifested arising from it only as support the tree's trunk is Bodhi

36
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:09,519
(enlightenment or awakening). Its inward cavities the channels of the sense the great elements its

37
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:15,189
branches the objects of the senses its leaves its fair flowers good and

38
00:03:15,409 --> 00:03:19,689
evil pleasure and pain the consequent fruits. This

39
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,559
Eternal Brahma tree is the source of life for all beings."

40
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:27,819
Whether upside down or right side up these trees have particular structures

41
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:33,669
which can be interpreted as containing the entire universe while also providing delicious and

42
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:40,298
Occasionally dangerous snacks sometimes though these trees represent far less than the whole world or universe

43
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,819
trees are also often involved in myths about

44
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,780
personal transformation

45
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:51,069
And it makes sense trees have an annual cycle of change and many even seem to die and come back to life each year

46
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:55,539
We've already seen one tree transformation myth in the story of totes pal Osiris

47
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:59,199
Although that one is complicated because Osiris is entombed in a coffin

48
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,999
Which is then enclosed in a tree for another tree's formation?

49
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:10,179
we're heading to Greece for Daphne and Apollo the myth of Daphne and Apollo begins with Apollo making fun of

50
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,449
Eros whom you may know better as Cupid. Here's a tip though

51
00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:17,918
Don't make fun of babies with a bow and arrow because babies with a bow and arrow are

52
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:25,029
Dangerous in revenge eros looses two magic arrows one of gold and one of lead. The gold one is for Apollo

53
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,139
And it makes him fall in love with the nymph Daphne. So far so cute

54
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:37,089
But then he shoots, Daphne with the lead arrow and as soon as Daphne sees Apollo. She is deeply and madly

55
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,689
disgusted by him Apollo pursues

56
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:48,399
Daphne and Daphne rejects him Apollo is persistent and Daphne keeps shooting him down mortal men might take the hint

57
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:55,060
But Apollo is a God and gods do not take hints before you know it Apollo is literally chasing Daphne across Greece

58
00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:03,130
Not especially interested in the advances of a god she despises Daphne cries out to her father Finneus the river god for help

59
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:08,920
Asking him to make the earth swallow her up or transform her into something else

60
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:16,119
Both are preferable to sex with Apollo her dad goes for the transformation option turning daphne into a laurel tree

61
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,209
Apollo looks at the tree and realizes he

62
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,930
loves

63
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:25,630
This tree after some rather uncomfortable and unfortunate tree molesting

64
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:30,159
He decrees that the laurel will forever be his symbol and Daphne

65
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,810
Well, we don't know how Daphne feels about it

66
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:33,730
She's a tree now

67
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,390
But my guess is that she is not

68
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:40,899
Super thrilled with this outcome a different tree transformation myth takes us to a part of the world. We haven't visited yet

69
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:47,739
Vietnam. here the story of ton lung and Tao is both a transformation story and an etiological

70
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,260
story explaining a traditional Vietnamese

71
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,109
Marriage custom tun and lung are two brothers

72
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,380
They're not twins

73
00:05:54,380 --> 00:06:00,219
But they're very very similar almost no one can tell them apart except for their friend Tao

74
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:06,100
The daughter of the village teacher she learns which brother is which by staring deeply into their eyes

75
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,950
she knows the older brother tun is the

76
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,439
extroverted one while the young Lung is

77
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:18,820
Quiet and thoughtful one day Tao realizes that tun is in love with her before she knows what to do tons parents have come to

78
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,159
Ask for Tao's hand she and her parents

79
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,679
Agree Tun and Tao are married and Tao travels to live with her new husband's family

80
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,200
Tony is happily married, but still loves his younger brother so he tries to include Lung. Tun

81
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,969
AsksLung to come on walks with him and Tao, but the younger brother always refuses

82
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:43,839
Tao is sensitive to the emotions of the two brothers and one day she realizes that despite his quiet exterior, Lung is

83
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:50,560
Deeply in love with her eventually his desires become too much to bear so he moves to a remote mountain

84
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,890
To garden and to write, and I mean hey

85
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:02,049
We've all been after ten days without his brother Tun is beside himself with worry and goes to search for him leaving Tao behind

86
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:06,700
After another 10 days Tao becomes worried and goes to search for the brothers

87
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:13,149
She heads to the mountains up a treacherous path to a river. That's too fast and wide to cross

88
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,299
There's no ferry and the weather is starting to turn so she knocks on the door of a nearby Hut

89
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,320
Let's find out what happens next

90
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:26,320
In the thought bubble inside the hut town meets a kindly old couple she asked them if they'd seen

91
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,830
Two men one dressed in white and the other in green yes

92
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:35,020
The old man says about a month ago my wife found a man dressed all in white sitting by the river

93
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:38,290
He was weeping and acting as if he was embracing someone

94
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:44,080
But it was only the air it began to rain so she came back to the house to fetch a rain jacket for him

95
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:49,240
I brought the rain jacket the old woman says and asked the man to put it on and join us in the house

96
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:55,210
He said nothing so I laid the jacket down beside me the next day the man in white wasn't there?

97
00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:01,720
But where he had been sitting there was a strange white rock ten days later another man this one dressed in green

98
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,200
Came by and asked if they'd seen a man dressed in white

99
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:11,679
We showed him the rock and told him the story the old man says the man in green cried that his brother

100
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:19,329
Had turned to stone he embraced the rock and wept bitterly and when another storm came through he like his brother

101
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:26,050
Refused to leave the spot the next day the man in green was also gone and by the rock stood a new

102
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:32,379
Tree that had not been there before the tree seemed to be protecting the rock the next morning Tao

103
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,349
Goes down to the river

104
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:35,179
she kneels by the rock and

105
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:39,909
Embraces the tree crying into its leaves when the couple wakes up Tao is nowhere to be found

106
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:45,969
but they do find a new vine with its roots deep in the ground twisting up the tree as if

107
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:50,229
Embracing and supporting it and when the old couple pluck a leaf from the vine

108
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:55,479
It's smell reminds them the young woman who had spent the night in their Hut

109
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,919
Thanks, thought-bubble this sweet, but tragic story of love and devotion

110
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:07,510
Doesn't end there though one summer afternoon the king comes to the river and sits on the strange rock under the strange tree

111
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,280
Supported by the strange vine. He asks his attendant. What sort of tree

112
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:18,819
Is it and orders him to pick one of its fruits another attendant tells the king the story of Lung Tun and Tao?

113
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:23,770
Explaining the white rock represents lung pure heart the tree represents

114
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,489
Tuns attempt to protect his brother and the vine shows

115
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:32,489
Tao's Love for her husband the king tastes the fruit wrapped in the leaf of the vine

116
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,650
Mixed with a bit of the rock and finds the taste most agreeable strange

117
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,730
He enjoyed eating rocks

118
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:42,539
but afterward he declares that the love of these two brothers and the

119
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:46,140
married couple is so strong that it has produced a

120
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,150
Lovely fruit and from that point the fruit and the leaf and the rock would be used at marriage

121
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:56,880
proposals and weddings as a symbol of both love and fidelity mythological trees vary in size and

122
00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:04,109
Meaning some are large enough to contain the whole world others are slender plants meant to represent a single young woman or man

123
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,410
deciduous trees with their cycles of birth and death

124
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:11,669
Lend themselves to metaphor as does their shape with branches reaching towards the sky and roots

125
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:17,909
Burrowing into the ground trees can live for hundreds if not thousands of years much longer than humans

126
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:24,299
So it makes sense that they might come to represent something greater than the relatively frail human form

127
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:29,580
But poignantally they also serve as a retreat for Humanity when the sorrows of

128
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:34,589
Unrequited love or the threat of abuse become too much to endure

129
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:38,489
