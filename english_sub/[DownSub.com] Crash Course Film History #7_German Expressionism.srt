1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,620
The earliest days of film were possibly when
cinema was its most global as a medium.

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,790
There was no synchronous sound, so filmmakers
had to tell their stories visually – with

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:15,000
tools like framing, shot size, and editing
– instead of with spoken dialogue.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,940
Because of this, films could be understood
across cultures: Someone throws a punch at

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,680
the camera, and you flinch, whether you speak
English or Russian... or Eagle.

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,900
So far, we’ve been focusing a lot on France
and the United States, where many advances

7
00:00:24,919 --> 00:00:27,419
in film technology, storytelling, and commerce
were born.

8
00:00:27,419 --> 00:00:29,529
But the rest of the world wasn’t very far
behind.

9
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:32,500
Europe had a vibrant film culture leading
right up to 1914, and the outbreak of World

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,700
War I, which profoundly changed world history - as world wars tend to do -

11
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,420
and left an impact on cinema that’s still felt to this day.

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,140
German film, especially, became stranger and
darker, as filmmakers attempted to disorient

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,340
the audience and immerse us in the heads of
their main characters.

14
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:50,140
It’s time to delve into the psychological
depths of German Expressionism.

15
00:00:50,140 --> 00:01:02,460
[OPENING MUSIC PLAYS]

16
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,920
When you think of World War I, you might think
of trench warfare, chemical weapons, or a

17
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,760
war that began with an assassin’s bullet.

18
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,740
But the war’s effect on the burgeoning global
film industry – as well as its political

19
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,490
and psychological influence on emerging filmmakers
– was deep and powerful.

20
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:18,979
In countries like France, Italy, and the U.K.,
World War I brought feature film production

21
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:23,049
to a near-standstill, because the infrastructure
and facilities were destroyed, or because

22
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:25,360
the filmmakers and their equipment were conscripted
into the war effort.

23
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,200
You see, film was used to bring images of
battle and its aftermath to audiences far

24
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,200
from the front lines.

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,770
The two national film industries most affected
by World War I were those of Germany and Russia.

26
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,100
For now, let’s focus on Germany.

27
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,289
We’ll get to Russia next time.

28
00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:41,380
Prior to the war, German films fell firmly
within our idea of a “cinema of attractions”

29
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,680
– they were spectacles designed for entertainment.

30
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,680
Like me.

31
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,000
As film became a more sophisticated medium,
many German filmmakers took a page from the

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,240
French “film d’art” movement.

33
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,700
They began thinking more about the craft of
narrative filmmaking, telling more complex

34
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,940
stories rooted in specific characters’ experiences.

35
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,240
Sounds boring to me. Where are the explosions, am I right?

36
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,219
And they called this kind of film Autorenfilm,
or “famous author’s film.”

37
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:05,539
In 1913, director Stellan Rye made a film
called Der Student von Prag, or The Student

38
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:09,258
from Prague, that finally unshackled German
film from theatrical staging – the Proscenium

39
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:11,009
arch approach we talked about before.

40
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:15,060
This freed the camera to enter a scene and
join the action, rather than sitting back to observe.

41
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,900
By the mid-1910s, the German government realized
that its film industry wasn’t at the same

42
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,239
level as that of the United States, France,
Italy, or England.

43
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,340
Combine that with the country’s struggles
with pre-war depression and anti-government

44
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,379
propaganda, and you had a recipe for trouble.

45
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:31,650
In 1917, the German military supreme command
took control of all the major film studios

46
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,280
and production companies and consolidated
them under one, enormous, state-sponsored

47
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,470
entity called UFA.

48
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:40,290
The idea was to centralize all the film talent,
equipment, and facilities in the country,

49
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,329
and to focus on nationalist films – a pro-German,
pro-government cinema that would help them

50
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:45,329
win the war.

51
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:48,860
Imagine if the U.S. military took over and
combined Warner Brothers, Paramount, Disney,

52
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:54,970
Universal, Fox, Sony, Canon Films (Breakin' 2:Electric Boogaloo?) – all the major
film studios.

53
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,530
And then told them what they could and couldn’t
make.

54
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,150
That’s a lot of resources, and a lot of
power.

55
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,530
Now, Germany lost the war… badly.

56
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,340
And in the aftermath, Imperial rule ended
and a national assembly in the city of Weimar

57
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,220
gave birth to a new republican government.

58
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,180
This era in German history – which we call
the Weimar Period – was marked by hyperinflation,

59
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,879
political extremism, violence, and deeply
troubled relationships with the countries

60
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,879
that had won the war.

61
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:19,439
But Germany was left with a huge infrastructure
for film production and distribution that

62
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,709
actually grew during the war, while the rest
of the economy went into a free fall.

63
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:26,300
Meanwhile, the rest of Europe’s filmmaking
capacity had been all but decimated.

64
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:30,930
So by 1920, Germany had the only film industry
in the world able to compete with Hollywood.

65
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:37,079
The first post-war films made by UFA were
beautiful costume dramas, or “Kostumfilme.” -- Aptly Named.

66
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:40,609
Their aim was to compete with the popular,
large-scale historical spectacles made by

67
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:44,739
Italy before the war, to entertain and distract
audiences from the devastated economy.

68
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:48,709
A filmmaker named Ernst Lubitsch became the
acknowledged master of the Kostumfilme, known

69
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:51,540
for his huge crowd scenes and mastery of artificial
lighting.

70
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,880
Hopefully known for his costumes, too. I would think. I mean, it's a Kostumfilme. You better have costumes.

71
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,770
His first big international hit was Madame
DuBarry, also known as Passion, made in 1919.

72
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:05,420
And in just over a decade, he would become
the first high-profile German director to

73
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,200
emigrate to Hollywood to escape the rise of
Nazi rule.

74
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,989
Now, with UFA sucking up all the filmmaking
oxygen in Germany, there wasn’t much room

75
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:13,670
for independent production companies.

76
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,989
And yet a few persisted.

77
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:18,620
One of them, called Decla, knew they couldn’t
compete with UFA in terms of scale or resources.

78
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,738
They were even hamstrung by the rationing
of electricity, which limited the lighting

79
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:22,739
they could use.

80
00:04:22,739 --> 00:04:25,259
So the producers knew they had to do something
different to get people’s attention

81
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:26,259
– and they did.

82
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:29,680
Their breakout film would reshape the German
film style, and eventually influence the look

83
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,730
and tone of Hollywood genre movies.

84
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,080
It was called The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.

85
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,980
This little studio, made a movie that changed the face of cinema!

86
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,740
Written by Hans Janowitz and Carl Mayer, this
film was thematically based on their experiences

87
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,050
as soldiers in World War I and their distrust
of authoritarian leadership.

88
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:48,020
It tells the story of a young German man who
meets a madman doctor whose somnambulist – a

89
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:51,699
kind of sleepwalking zombie – may also be
a serial killer, targeting the young man’s

90
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:53,170
best friend and the woman he loves.

91
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,380
The story gains a level of complexity at the
end when it’s revealed that...

92
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,150
Spoiler... get ready.

93
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,160
– our hero is an unreliable narrator.

94
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:03,900
He lives in a mental institution and may have
made up the entire plot using his fellow inmates

95
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,550
and the director of the asylum as models for
his characters.

96
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,550
Creepy, right?

97
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:11,289
What made the film stand out in 1920, and
even today, is its use of mise-en-scène.

98
00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:14,570
Mise-en-scène refers to the arrangement of
things that appear in front of the camera.

99
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:19,140
All the physical stuff in a shot: the sets,
props, costumes, makeup, actors and their

100
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,669
blocking, and the lighting.

101
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:21,669
Pretty much everything.

102
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:26,100
And Caligari’s innovation was to use mise-en-scène
expressionistically, rather than realistically.

103
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,250
That is, instead of making things like the
sets, costumes, and props, as realistic as

104
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,199
possible, director Robert Weine and his two
production designers deliberately distorted

105
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,259
everything within the frame.

106
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:37,960
It’s all designed to look deliberately artificial
and throw you off balance – from chairs,

107
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,900
desks, and doors that are way too tall, to
impossibly peaked roofs, and even shafts of

108
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,630
moonlight painted across the set.

109
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,550
The pale-faced, dark-eyed makeup of the characters,
as well as they way they move – particularly

110
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:50,890
the sleepwalking killer Cesare – is meant
to be super creepy.

111
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:54,690
This is the heart of German Expressionism,
using an exaggerated, distorted mise-en-scène

112
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,949
to reflect the inner psychology of the characters.

113
00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:00,199
It’s the world’s first taste of highly
subjective filmmaking as well – putting

114
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:04,289
us in the mind of an insane main character
and making us experience the world as he does.

115
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:08,340
Given its anti-authoritarian themes, exaggerated
mise-en-scène, subjective point of view,

116
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,169
and twist ending, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari
is a powerhouse of a story.

117
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:14,940
It made at least four breakthroughs all at
once for the history of film.

118
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,350
And although Caligari wasn’t an immediate
hit, other filmmakers soon began to pick up

119
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,350
its techniques.

120
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,800
Even UFA started to borrow its style.

121
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,540
And, before long, expressionistic mise-en-scène
became a hallmark of German cinema in the

122
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,599
Weimar Period.

123
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:28,740
Because UFA was the largest film studio in
the world at the time, it attracted young

124
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,920
filmmakers and technicians from all over Europe
– including a 25-year-old Alfred Hitchcock.

125
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,060
Then, as Germany took a hard right toward
fascism, many German filmmakers fled for London,

126
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,449
New York, or Hollywood, taking the techniques
of German Expressionism with them.

127
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:44,840
Watch a film noir from the 1930s or a horror
film from the 1940s, or even a studio melodrama

128
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,229
like Douglas Sirk’s All that Heaven Allows
from 1955, and you’ll see the deep influence

129
00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:50,230
of German Expressionism.

130
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,629
Heck, take another look at David Fincher’s
Se7en, and tell me those grisly murder scenes

131
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:56,080
and that ending would exist without Caligari.

132
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,120
WHAT'S IN THE BOOOOOOX?!?!

133
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,880
Now, another German filmmaker from the Weimar
Period we should talk about is Fritz Lang.

134
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,940
Lang started as an architect, and, boy, does
it show in his work.

135
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:07,849
His films depict grand, epic spaces, and he
pays incredibly close attention to the details

136
00:07:07,849 --> 00:07:08,900
and structure of his narratives.

137
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,680
They feel solid, like you could live in them.

138
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,139
He borrowed heavily from Caligari’s use
of mise-en-scène to amplify his own rich

139
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:15,650
and morally-complex stories.

140
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,009
But his films were less intellectual, and
more interested in exploring the visceral

141
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:20,310
emotions of characters.

142
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:24,620
Lang’s masterpiece is the sci-fi epic Metropolis,
which combined German Expressionist techniques

143
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,340
with his interest in special effects.

144
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,090
The film is set in a futuristic society, in
which the wealthy live in luxury high above

145
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,160
the toiling masses.

146
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,780
It’s a love story between the son of the
ruler of this society, and a poor worker from

147
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,330
down below – which, y’know, is par for
the course in dystopian stories.

148
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:41,520
Metropolis was a precursor to everything from
Blade Runner to The Hunger Games, but it was

149
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,569
also a huge financial failure at the time.

150
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:46,610
It took decades before it was hailed as a
dark and sinister classic.

151
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,319
Now, no discussion of German Expressionism
is complete without mentioning the other major

152
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,349
director of the time: F.W. Murnau.

153
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:55,610
Murnau was an art historian before he was
a filmmaker, and wanted to make a film of

154
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,330
Bram Stoker’s Dracula, but couldn’t afford
the rights to the book.

155
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,819
So he just… fudged it a bit.

156
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:03,360
He changed some of the names, rearranged some
locations, and made his own version of the

157
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,610
same story in 1922, called Nosferatu.

158
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:10,169
He was heavily inspired by Caligari, but instead
of building exaggerated sets, Murnau focused

159
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:13,599
more on lighting, staging, special effects,
and makeup to get at the characters’ inner

160
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:14,599
psychology.

161
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,189
Murnau would eventually turn his attention
to Kammerspielfilm, or the “Intimate Theater”

162
00:08:18,189 --> 00:08:22,280
film tradition, which tried to depict the
oppressiveness of middle class life in
contemporary Germany.

163
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,520
He remained as experimental as ever, particularly
with camera movement.

164
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,680
His 1924 film The Last Laugh, for instance,
is a masterclass in what Murnau called the

165
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:31,000
“unchained camera.”

166
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,990
From pans and tilts to dolly and crane shots,
his camera never stops moving, in an attempt

167
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,980
to make us feel what his characters are feeling.

168
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,880
Can you move our camera around for the rest of the video, Nick?

169
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,440
Nick: No.

170
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,880
That... that's fine.

171
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,380
That same year, the United States and its
European allies implemented the Dawes Plan,

172
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,640
to try and help Germany pay for the extensive
damage it caused during the war.

173
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,080
So the extra aid from the Dawes Plan was good
for the German economy overall, but it was

174
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,700
a gut punch to the film industry.

175
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,070
Among other things, it strangled exports,
meaning that German films had a much harder

176
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,140
time finding distribution outside of the country.

177
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,371
That in turn made it harder for production
companies to get loans from the banks, so

178
00:09:05,371 --> 00:09:09,700
many independent companies ended up declaring
bankruptcy between 1924 and 1925.

179
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,339
American film studios saw the chance to take
out their greatest rivals, and flooded Germany

180
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:14,490
with Hollywood films.

181
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,950
Germany’s days as a leader in global cinema
were over.

182
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:20,800
That said, German cinema of the Weimar period
has had a profound and long-lasting influence

183
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,120
on film history, like few other movements
have.

184
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,529
From The Silence of the Lambs to Don’t Breathe
to anything M. Night Shyamalan has ever put

185
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:30,330
on film, the techniques of German Expressionism
are creeping us out to this very day.

186
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:34,450
Today we talked about how the political climate
during and after World War I influenced filmmakers

187
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,740
across the world and the German film industry.

188
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,640
We learned about styles and techniques that
emerged from this post-war society, like German

189
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,350
Expressionism’s exaggerated mise-en-scène
and Murnau’s “unchained camera”.

190
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,491
And we looked at how filmmakers like Weine,
Lubitsch, and Lang taught the world to use

191
00:09:47,491 --> 00:09:51,120
these tools of cinema to bring audiences more
directly into the minds of characters.

192
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,160
Next time, we’ll witness how the Russian
Revolution incited a lot of filmmaking study

193
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,620
and innovation too – especially in editing
– and delve into the theory of Soviet Montage.

194
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,180
Crash Course Film History is produced in association
with PBS Digital Studios.
