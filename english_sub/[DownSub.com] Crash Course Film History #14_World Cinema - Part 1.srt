00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,820
News flash: the world’s a big place. WHAT!?!?!

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,069
Huh!

3
00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:10,760
And humans have been making films in almost
every corner of it for more than a hundred years.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,200
While Hollywood dominated the global film
market in its first six or seven decades,

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,530
lots of profoundly influential film movements
arose all over the world.

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,610
Now, there’s way too much to cover in just
two videos.

7
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,520
But, hopefully, these overviews will inspire
you to explore more on your own.

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,120
To start, let’s look at a few key movements
and filmmakers throughout Asia that were born

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,520
out of intense political change and had a
lasting impact on world cinema.

00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:42,520
[Intro Music Plays]

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,760
During the 1930s, the Japanese government

12
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,979
placed stringent controls over domestic film
production through its Ministry of Propaganda.

13
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:52,300
They censored content that didn’t uphold
the values of the Imperial government, and

14
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,979
promoted movies that celebrated the Japanese
military.

15
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:58,739
After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Ministry
of Propaganda borrowed a page from the Nazi

16
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:02,089
playbook and actually took over the country’s
ten largest film studios.

17
00:01:02,089 --> 00:01:06,100
Then, they consolidated these studios into
two main production companies and forced them

18
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,490
to make pro-war movies.

19
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:11,280
Now, real battle footage from the Pacific
was hard to come by, so these wartime Japanese

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,870
filmmakers got really good at creating special
effects.

21
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,840
And that experience would come in handy after
the war, when they were given more artistic freedom.

22
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,880
Yasujiro Ozu is widely acknowledged
as one of the masters of classical Japanese

23
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,320
cinema, a period that stretched from 1926
to the 1950s.

24
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,520
Ozu began his career making quiet, humanistic
films about family relationships and intergenerational conflicts.

25
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,760
He grew up admiring American studio films,
especially those by Ernst Lubitsch and D.W. Griffith.

26
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,200
Ozu’s first film to achieve wide acclaim
was a comedy called I Was Born, But….

27
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,649
The film follows a pair of brothers who lose
faith in their father when they discover he’s

28
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:44,009
not standing up to his boss.

29
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:48,659
A lot of Ozu movies embed this kind of gentle
social critique into their very personal stories.

30
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,780
Aesthetically, Ozu is known for his long,
wide shots that allow entire scenes to play

31
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,320
out, sometimes very slowly.

32
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,400
This is often considered to be a reflection
of the power of ritual in traditional Japanese life.

33
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,800
He also innovated the use of offscreen space,
having characters exit the frame for surprisingly

34
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:06,539
long periods of time, and letting the camera
linger on the now-empty space.

35
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:09,419
These moments echo certain Zen aesthetics
about emptiness and patience.

36
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,410
And they root Ozu’s films in ancient Japanese
customs and beliefs, even though his stories

37
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,530
take place in what was then the present day.

38
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:20,580
After the war, Ozu went on to make three masterpieces:
Late Spring, Early Summer, and his most famous

39
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,620
film, Tokyo Story.

40
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,060
Now, the end of the war brought profound changes
to the Japanese film industry.

41
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:29,000
Much of the country was scarred, both physically
and psychologically, having suffered a massive

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,610
firebombing campaign and atomic explosions
at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

43
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,350
One kind of postwar Japanese cinema dealt
with the aftermath of these atomic bombs in

44
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,190
very direct, explicit ways.

45
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,300
It’s impossible to watch Ishiro Honda’s
1954 film Godzilla and not see the parable

46
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,000
underneath the sci-fi monster movie.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
...and also not try to mimic Godzilla's noise.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,720
Craig: ahhhh... ahhhh
Nick: You're not doing a very good job.

49
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,240
No, I'm not doing a very good job.

50
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,000
The creature is unleashed by careless atomic

51
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,090
explosions, and the human characters spend
the movie wrestling with the potentially apocalyptic

52
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,960
consequences of scientific research.

53
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,730
Godzilla and its sequels also show off the
sophistication of the Japanese special effects

54
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,820
industry, as all that work during the war
was now beginning to pay off.

55
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,730
After the war, General Douglas MacArthur led
the American Occupation forces which oversaw

56
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:14,430
the “democratization” of Japan from 1945
to 1952.

57
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,940
And this brought a new kind of censorship
to Japanese films.

58
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,440
They were forbidden from glorifying imperialism,
feudalism, and militarism.

59
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,680
The Occupation forces rounded up and destroyed
hundreds of films that were deemed anti-democratic.

60
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,540
Under the Occupation, the state-run film companies
were broken up to foster competition, and

61
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,370
filmmakers were encouraged to make movies
that celebrated democratic values

62
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,370
and personal freedoms.

63
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,720
One filmmaker who flourished in this postwar
period was Akira Kurosawa, who would go on

64
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,080
to become one of the most influential filmmakers
in the history of cinema.

65
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,800
For real. He's a big deal.

66
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,730
Kurosawa became an international star with
his 1951 revolutionary film Rashomon.

67
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:50,680
It tells the story of the murder of a samurai
warrior through the eyes of four unreliable

68
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,680
narrators.

69
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,770
We see the events of the film four times,
each time from a different point of view.

70
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,590
And the film never tells us which version
of events actually happened.

71
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,850
Kurosawa seems to imply that truth and reality
are subjective, in both cinema and life, and

72
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,920
that our only hope is to be as good to one
another as we possibly can.

73
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,840
YA, NICK!

74
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,040
Unlike Ozu, Kurosawa kept his camera moving,

75
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,570
a style he would bring to many of his later
samurai films.

76
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,750
And he was often borrowing stories from other
cultures.

77
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,149
His samurai movie Yojimbo was based on an
American detective novel by Dashiell Hammett.

78
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:20,119
Throne of Blood was a Japanese re-telling
of Shakespeare’s Macbeth.

79
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,920
And he used King Lear as the basis for his
samurai epic Ran.

80
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,090
In turn, Kurosawa inspired many foreign films
based on his work.

81
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,940
George Lucas famously lifted elements of
Kurosawa’s The Hidden Fortress for the first

82
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,960
Star Wars film.

83
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,570
And Kurosawa’s masterpiece Seven Samurai
has been remade twice in the United States

84
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:35,760
as The Magnificent Seven.

85
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,560
I guess that makes it the "Magnificent Fourteen." *giggle*

86
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,400
From anime to horror and period dramas to
Kaiju films, stories from the Japanese movie

87
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,620
industry continue to resonate around the globe.

88
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,850
Now, in mainland China, the film industry
also underwent some significant changes because

89
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:50,850
of political pressures.

90
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,000
The first domestic films emerged in 1905.

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,150
And within five years, a stable industry began
to form, starting in Shanghai and spreading

92
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,570
to other coastal cities.

93
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:02,120
Sound was introduced in 1929 and China’s
film industry continued to grow, until the

94
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,690
Japanese invaded in 1937, occupied Shanghai,
and shut down domestic production until the

95
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:07,690
end of the war.

96
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:11,341
When Mao Zedong’s Communist Party took over
the country in 1949, they placed control of

97
00:05:11,341 --> 00:05:13,430
film production under the Minister of Culture.

98
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,180
During the 1950s, the Chinese government built
a dozen major film studios throughout the

99
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,600
country and produced a lot of pro-Communist
films.

100
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,510
In the early 1960s, the government censors
relaxed enough to allow film adaptations of

101
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,290
several operas and novels.

102
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:29,410
Before this, works like Su Li’s Third Sister
Liu and Early Spring in February by Xie Tieli

103
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,720
would have been considered too bourgeois to
produce.

104
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,700
Then in 1966 came the Cultural Revolution,
a violent, decade-long purge of most cultural

105
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,800
and economic institutions in China.

106
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,260
Professionals of all kinds, including filmmakers,
were driven from their jobs and homes by the

107
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,720
Chinese government, and sent off to be “re-educated”
in the countryside.

108
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,670
As a result, film production came to a halt
in 1967 and wouldn’t resume for another

109
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,670
three years.

110
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,680
And even then, only amateur filmmakers were
allowed to make movies at first.

111
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,400
Eventually, through fits and starts, professional
filmmakers emerged from their re-education

112
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,620
camps or graduated from new film schools and
began making movies again.

113
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,640
One of the most notable directors from mainland
China is Zhang Yimou.

114
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:08,880
His first film, the sumptuously shot Red Sorghum,
won the top prize at the Berlin Film Festival in 1987.

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,800
Known for his striking visuals and painterly
style, Zhang made several notable martial

116
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,790
arts films in the early 2000s – movies like
Hero and House of Flying Daggers – before

117
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:20,270
overseeing the Opening Ceremonies for the
Beijing Olympics in 2008.

118
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,010
Zhang has even worked with American movie
stars.

119
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:25,750
Matt Damon and Willem Dafoe play lead roles
in his 2017 film The Great Wall.

120
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,560
This collaboration may be the first of many,
since well-financed Chinese production companies

121
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,400
have begun to partner with American studios
to make films for audiences in both countries

122
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,610
and beyond.

123
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:38,920
Outside of mainland China, Hong Kong has a
long tradition of kung fu and swordplay films.

124
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,660
I just kung fu'd the eagle.

125
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:47,280
Its film industry elevated these violent genres
to art in the 1960s and ‘70s, through precisely

126
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,040
choreographed action and rapid editing.

127
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,380
Figures like Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan popularized
this authentic martial arts cinema outside

128
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,380
Hong Kong.

129
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,660
And directors like John Woo even went on to
make blockbusters within the American studio

130
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,370
system – films like Face/Off and Mission:
Impossible II.

131
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:03,750
Wong Kar-wai is another superstar director
from the Hong Kong film industry.

132
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:08,090
His elliptical, post-modern films often examine
unrequited love and the deep interior lives

133
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,090
of their characters.

134
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:12,610
From the dreamlike lyricism of In the Mood
for Love, to the martial arts grandeur of

135
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,790
The Grand Master, his films have had a profound
influence on filmmakers throughout the world.

136
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,380
As big as China and Hong Kong loom on the
world stage, the largest film industry in

137
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,510
the world is located in India.

138
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,440
All told, the country produces eight- to nine-hundred
movies a year,

139
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,400
roughly a quarter of the world’s films.

140
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,389
So India had a growing film industry under
British Colonial Rule in the early part of

141
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:32,820
the 20th century, prior to winning their independence.

142
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,389
They ran into trouble, though, when sound
film arrived.

143
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:37,520
Because India makes films in more than sixteen
languages!

144
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,169
When you hear the term Bollywood, for instance,
that refers to film production centered in

145
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,169
Bombay.

146
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:45,250
These Hindi-language films make up 25 percent
of Indian cinema.

147
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:49,161
Bengali-language film production occurs mostly
in Calcutta, while facilities in Madras produce

148
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:51,330
Tamil-, Kannada-, and Telugu- language films.

149
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:55,050
Despite the language differences, what unifies
most Indian films is their style.

150
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:59,590
Most Indian cinema consists of lavish musicals
or mythological romances, all following relatively

151
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:00,590
strict formulas.

152
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:04,810
For the musicals, the saying goes, all you
need is “a star, six songs, and three dances.”

153
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,820
The Indian star system actually resembles
the American studio era of the 1930s.

154
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:12,340
Actors are chosen and groomed by the film
studios, and plugged into movies built around

155
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,340
their personas.

156
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,760
Now, the most profitable movie ever produced
in India is Ramesh Sippy’s 1975 film Sholay.

157
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:22,000
It’s an action-adventure film heavily influenced
by Hollywood westerns, but also has its share

158
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,669
of over-the-top song-and-dance numbers.

159
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:27,300
The film was so popular when it was released
that it ran continuously in movie theaters

160
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,600
for five years! I can't even hold a job for five years.

161
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,800
Meanwhile, the universally-acknowledged master

162
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:36,958
of Indian cinema was Satyajit Ray, whose style
was different than most Indian films.

163
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,128
After studying as a painter, Ray found his
filmmaking inspiration in Italian Neo-Realism,

164
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:45,110
especially Vittorio De Sica’s classic The
Bicycle Thieves, the intimate story of a father

165
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,830
and son struggling to survive poverty in post-war
Italy.

166
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:52,100
In 1955, Ray made his first film, The Song
of the Road, which tells the story of a young

167
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,670
Bengali boy coming of age.

168
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:57,310
Unlike the spectacle of most Indian cinema,
Ray’s film focuses on the emotions of its

169
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:00,149
fully-realized characters, and intimate moments
of everyday life.

170
00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:04,220
The film became a surprise international hit
and won the Jury Prize at the 1956 Cannes

171
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,220
Film Festival.

172
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,939
In his next two films, 1957’s The Unvanquished
and 1959’s The World of Apu, Ray continued

173
00:09:09,939 --> 00:09:13,079
to follow the main character from his first
film as he matured into adolescence.

174
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:16,579
These three films together are known as the
“Apu Trilogy” and cemented Ray’s international

175
00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:18,760
reputation and low-key, contemplative style.

176
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,269
Indian cinema is more than just fun Bollywood spectacle.

177
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:25,330
It’s a multifaceted film industry that,
along with all these Asian film cultures,

178
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,699
has profoundly shaped modern filmmaking today
and for generations to come.

179
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:33,269
Today, we talked about post-war Japanese cinema
from Kurosawa’s samurai to Hondo’s Godzilla.

180
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:36,791
We scratched the surface of Chinese cinema,
from mainland epics to the martial arts film

181
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,350
traditions of Hong Kong.

182
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,420
And we looked at India, home to the largest
film industry in the world.

183
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,939
Next time, we’ll tackle indigenous cinema
from Africa and Latin America, to maverick

184
00:09:44,939 --> 00:09:46,329
filmmakers in the Middle East.

185
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:49,850
Crash Course Film History is produced in association
with PBS Digital Studios.

the Doctor Cheryl C. Kinney Crash Course Studio

189
00:09:59,680 --> 00:00:00,000
