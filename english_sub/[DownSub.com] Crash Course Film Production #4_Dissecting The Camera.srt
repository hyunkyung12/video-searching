1
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,440
Hey, you! Yeah, I’m talking to you. But,
I’m actually talking to a camera.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,470
A camera is a collection of parts that can

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:12,500
help you tell a visual story. It takes in
light through a lens and captures images,

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,980
creating that illusion of reality we keep
talking about.

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,080
You could even use your cell phone camera
to make a movie! But filmmakers usually have

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,670
equipment that gives them a lot more control.
So, let’s look through the eyes of a cinematographer,

7
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,880
and see how they combine camera technology
and the language of film to get that perfect shot

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:39,560
[Intro Music Plays]

9
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,120
Let’s start with the tool that focuses light
into a camera: the lens.

10
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,360
Some cameras have a lens that’s permanently
attached, but others have a separate body

11
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,899
with a lens mount, where you can swap out
different lenses for more creative control.

12
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:54,130
For instance, low-budget filmmakers can rent
great lenses for cost-effective cameras to

13
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:58,740
improve their footage quality. Or they might use older lenses to make a period piece feel more authentic.

14
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,620
All lenses have either a fixed or variable

15
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:04,080
focal length, which is the distance from the center of the lens to where the image is in focus.

16
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,030
And focal length determines your field of view,

17
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,259
which is how much you can see in frame.
It’s usually measured in millimeters, and

18
00:01:10,259 --> 00:01:13,479
a 50mm lens is generally thought to be closest
to how our eyes frame the world.

19
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:17,539
A fixed focal length lens can be called a
prime lens. It tends to have higher quality

20
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:20,219
glass because it’s specialized for just
one focal length.

21
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:23,979
On the other hand, a variable focal length
lens is more versatile. It’s also called

22
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,360
a zoom lens, because it can zoom in and out.

23
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,540
Now, you can also control how much light

24
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,159
gets into the camera body through a hole called
the aperture.

25
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:34,980
It works like the iris and pupil in your eye,
becoming wider or narrower to let more or

26
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:39,409
less light through the lens. Aperture is measured
in f-stops. That lowercase “f” stands

27
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:43,820
for focal length, because it’s the ratio
of the focal length compared to the diameter of the aperture.

28
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,240
An f/1.2 lens, for example, can open wider

29
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,390
than an f/5.6. So when you “stop down”
your aperture, you’re making that diameter

30
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,480
of the opening smaller, letting less light
in, and changing that ratio.

31
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,400
But, as you stop down, you'll notice that the number is actually getting larger.

32
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,539
And to control how long the film or sensor
inside is exposed to light, you can adjust

33
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:03,729
the camera’s shutter speed. You can think
of a typical shutter as a door in the lens

34
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:05,140
that opens and closes really quickly.

35
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,049
If you have an aperture that can open wider,

36
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:11,200
like in a f/1.2 lens, you can let more light
in, and have a faster shutter speed.

37
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,959
Usually your shutter speed is about double your frame
rate. So if you’re shooting 24 frames per

38
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,680
second, for instance, your shutter speed would
be 1/50 seconds.

39
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,080
But there’s one little problem with shutters
that work like a door: they click. Which can get noisy.

40
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,820
So on some movie film cameras, you’ll have a shutter angle instead of a shutter speed.

41
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,060
These shutters are rotary
discs that spin, to control the amount of

42
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:32,799
light that enters an opening into the camera.
A smaller shutter angle works like a faster

43
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:36,719
shutter speed: the image will be exposed more
quickly, and it’ll look crisper! With a

44
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,400
larger shutter angle or slower shutter speed, the image will be smoother and have more blur from any motion.

45
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,379
How light gets turned into an image depends

46
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:48,170
on what kind of camera you’re using.
In a film camera, the light hits the chemical-coated

47
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:52,370
film strip at an opening called the gate,
which exposes it so it retains an image.

48
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:56,659
In a digital camera, the light heads to an
electronic sensor, which translates the light

49
00:02:56,659 --> 00:03:00,219
energy into a digital image. The camera that’s
filming me right now has what’s called a

50
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,260
Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor, or
CMOS, sensor.

51
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,820
Other digital cameras might
have a Charged Coupled Device, or a CCD, which

52
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:11,680
uses more power, but produces better images
than earlier CMOS sensors.

53
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,110
Both film and digital sensors also have a
property called ISO. The higher the ISO number,

54
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,200
the more sensitive they are to light.

55
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,760
The name comes from the International Standards Organization,

56
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,160
which created the scale filmmakers
use.

57
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,760
Generally, the lower your ISO, the cleaner and richer your images will look.

58
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,600
But, if you’re in a room without a lot of light, your image will be pretty dark.

59
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,700
In this case, it’s
tempting to just bump your ISO way up to like

60
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,360
1600, to increase sensitivity to available light.

61
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,940
You’ve gotta be careful with that, though.
Depending on the camera or film stock, raising

62
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,900
the ISO to compensate for low light just brightens
everything in frame, and can result in grainy,

63
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,609
lower-quality footage.
So, instead of raising your ISO, you might

64
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:50,670
wanna add more light to the scene and open
the aperture to allow as much of it in as possible.

65
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,890
Now, imagine you’ve put everything we’ve

66
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:57,540
talked about to use. You’ve adjusted your
lens, aperture, shutter speed, and ISO, and

67
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,800
captured some beautiful footage.

68
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,180
All that
footage is stored on what’s called the media.

69
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:06,360
In a film camera, the media is the film itself. As long as you don’t lose or ruin it, you’ll always have what you shot.

70
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,760
In a digital camera, the media is a data storage

71
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,389
device like tape, drives, or cards. And you’ll
have to decide on a codec.

72
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:16,589
“Codec” is a portmanteau of “coder”
and “decoder.” Because that’s what it does.

73
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:20,279
It’s a program that can compress what
the camera has shot onto your storage device,

74
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,340
and then decompress that footage when you
need to work with it in post-production.

75
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,030
Basically, it’s like a little package of
digital information. You might recognize a

76
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,760
codec like H.264. Or mp3!

77
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,100
Shooting in raw
means the images don’t get packaged or processed.

78
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:38,080
You get higher quality footage, but you need
a bunch of storage because those image files get huge.

79
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,740
Now, understanding how a camera works is only part of a filmmaker’s job.

80
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,340
Film sets
have an entire team of talented artists working

81
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,090
to create the visual story of a movie.

82
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:50,251
The Director of Photography, or cinematographer,
is the head of the camera department. They

83
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:54,840
create the shot list with the director, to
plan how everything in the screenplay will be captured visually.

84
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,840
The camera operator is the person who actually

85
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,660
controls the camera and frames the shots.

86
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,660
Sometimes you need a static shot, so the camera

87
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,780
operator uses a tripod. The cool kids call
this a camera “on sticks.”

88
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,639
Or, sometimes you want a moving shot, so the
operator uses a handheld camera, or attaches

89
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,449
one to a mechanical cart called a dolly. There’s
also a device called a steadicam, which makes

90
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:15,440
a shot smoother than handheld, but not as
smooth as a dolly.

91
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,069
Now, the person who manages all this equipment
and sets up the camera is the First Assistant

92
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:23,449
Camera, or 1st AC. They work under the main
camera operator. Sometimes, you’ll hear

93
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:27,630
this job referred to as Focus Puller because
the 1st AC controls the camera lens to focus

94
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,280
on the actors as they move through the scene.

95
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,380
It might sound simple, but for decades focus pullers couldn’t look through the camera lens while doing their job,

96
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,900
because the camera operator was looking through the lens.

97
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,480
Nowadays, the 1st AC will usually have a monitor,

98
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,180
but they also have to rely on detailed marks
from rehearsal and a whole lot of skill.

99
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:47,310
The 2nd AC takes all the camera notes for
each shot and operates the slate, or clapper,

100
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,440
to mark each scene.

101
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,960
...ooof... Soft Sticks.

102
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,180
They also haul equipment
around, from cameras to media.

103
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,620
If you’re shooting film, a 2nd AC is the
film loader, who changes the camera magazines

104
00:05:57,629 --> 00:06:01,330
with rolls of film inside. And if you’re
shooting digital, the 2nd AC is responsible

105
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:06,050
for getting any storage devices to the Digital
Imaging Technician, or DIT, who manages all the media.

106
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,409
Now, you might understand the nuts and bolts

107
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:12,380
of a camera, but it’s all for nothing if
you’re not using these tools to tell a story.

108
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:16,940
Making the audience feel something because of moving pictures – that’s what makes movies magic!

109
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,760
From a voyeur shot through a window in a horror movie,

110
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,300
to the subtle push on the love interest
in a melodrama, there’s a language and an

111
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,640
artistry to framing, angles, and camera movements.

112
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,560
Take the rule of thirds, which is a general way to think about composing a frame.

113
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,760
The
idea is to divide it up into vertical and 
horizontal thirds,

114
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,880
and then stick what you
want people to focus on where those lines intersect.

115
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,699
What or who dominates a frame can affect how

116
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:41,580
an audience views a scene. And what’s in
or out of focus can steer our attention even more.

117
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,740
For instance, in the film Road to Perdition,

118
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,560
the cinematographer Conrad Hall combined these
storytelling tools really beautifully.

119
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,569
In one scene, a character played by Daniel
Craig is dominating the frame, but the other

120
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:55,479
two men walking away from him, played by Paul
Newman and Tom Hanks, are the ones in focus.

121
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:59,640
So our attention is on Daniel Craig’s character
because he’s front and center in the scene.

122
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,039
But because the other men are kept in focus,
we can feel that he’s thinking about them

123
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,060
– all through the visual storytelling.

124
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,960
Even if you can compose what looks like the perfect frame,

125
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,580
it’s important to remember that cameras
aren’t static!

126
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,720
Camera movements have their own language
too. This is a pan, moving left to right.

127
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,420
A push is when the camera is literally pushed
closer to the action in a scene.

128
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,620
It’s like we’re leaning in, and builds intensity.

129
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,259
And a pull is the opposite! The camera physically
moves back. This could reveal something that

130
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:26,629
we couldn’t see before, or help us leave
a scene and lessen our connection.

131
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:30,790
Pushes and pulls are often achieved by using
a dolly to move the camera closer and farther

132
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:34,229
from the action. They have a different look
to them than just changing the focal length

133
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:35,229
of a zoom lens.

134
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:38,949
If you want to get really fancy, you can use
a tracking shot to move the camera with

135
00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:42,740
your actors, like by moving a camera on a
dolly parallel to the action.

136
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:47,000
Now, even how a camera is set up can affect
the visual storytelling in a movie. A camera

137
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,780
on a tripod is “locked down” and can make
a scene feel safe and stable, like when a

138
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,289
character who craves adventure is sitting
at home in their regular life. But when they’re

139
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:57,780
introduced to whatever’s going to rock their
world, and jump up, the camera might move too.

140
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:01,220
On the other end of the spectrum are handheld
cameras. Think of those horror movies with

141
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:05,980
shaky cameras – they’re harder to see
and understand, but feel more chaotic and unstable.

142
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,199
The real job of the camera is to capture visuals

143
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:11,889
that let us enter the worlds of movies, and
feel what the characters feel.

144
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:15,600
Knowing how a camera works can help strengthen
your storytelling, but a lot of it comes down

145
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,900
to becoming fluent in the language of film.
And that, like all of these jobs, comes with

146
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,000
a ton of practice.

147
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,040
Today, we talked about the guts of the camera

148
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:26,930
and how they come together to make a versatile
piece of equipment. We learned about the positions

149
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:30,509
in the camera crew, and how the poetry of
framing, angles, and camera movement are what

150
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:34,500
make it a powerful storytelling tool.
And next time, we’ll talk about the counterpart

151
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,419
to the camera’s visuals: sound.

152
