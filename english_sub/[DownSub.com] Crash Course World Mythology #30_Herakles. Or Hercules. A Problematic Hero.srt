00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,170
Hi.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:05,310
I’m Mike Rugnetta, this is Crashcourse Mythology
and today we’re talking about another hero.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,170
One who eventually becomes a god.

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:09,360
A demi-god.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,210
Which is another way of saying semi-god.

6
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:12,210
Kinda.

7
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,580
Anyway, it’s our old friend Herakles!

8
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,310
Who some call “Hercules”: sometimes a
man, sometimes a god, but always a guy who

9
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,500
really knows how to rock a lion skin, right
Thoth?

10
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,670
[[Thoth in lion skin]] OH NO I MEAN - you
look really good too!

11
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:30,480
Very heroic.

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:38,470
INTRO
Herakles has a reputation for being kind of

13
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,470
a brute.

14
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,809
All brawn, no brain.

15
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:44,839
But… remember when we talked about Herakles
in an episode on tricksters?

16
00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:48,469
Remember how he tricks Atlas into holding
up the sky forever?

17
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:51,719
He may be buff, but Herakles sure ain’t
dense.

18
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,260
Though, he doesn’t always makes the best
choices.

19
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,129
Sometimes Herakles is his own worst enemy.

20
00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:01,190
Even worse than the hydra, and that was a
pretty bad one!

21
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,890
But let’s not get aHEAD... of ourselves!

22
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,640
Like many heroes, Herakles had a miraculous
birth.

23
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:14,450
Zeus, God of lightning bolts but not consent,
takes a liking to Alcmene, the queen of Thebes.

24
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:19,920
Zeus transforms himself into the form of the
king, Amphitryon, and sleeps with the Queen.

25
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,460
Nine months later Alcmene gives birth to two
boys, Iphicles and Alceides.

26
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,159
One of them is Amphitryon’s son, and the
other is Zeus’.

27
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,539
But oh DIVINE BOYS - which is which?!

28
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:33,939
This is how sitcoms get started.

29
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:38,789
When Hera finds out about this debacle ‒ yet
another Zeus-ian infidelity ‒ she sends

30
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:42,830
two revenge serpents to Iphicles and Alceides’
cribs.

31
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:48,539
When the king and queen rush in, Iphicles
is crying and Alceides is holding the two

32
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:51,939
serpents, strangled in each of his tiny baby
hands.

33
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:53,960
Mystery solved, I guess!

34
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,430
Alceides would later become … Herakles.

35
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:00,119
Alceides is raised as a prince of Thebes,
but he’s a bit of a problem child.

36
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,289
His godlike strength keeps getting him into
trouble.

37
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:09,758
At one point, he gets so mad at his music
teacher that he smashes a lyre over his head

38
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,230
and kills him.

39
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:16,590
This is the last straw for Amphitryon, and
the king sends the dangerous demi-god princeling

40
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,570
away to tend sheep.

41
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,170
As a shepherd, Herakles gets to put his great
strength to use.

42
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:28,620
A monstrous beast named the lion of Citharion
had been terrorizing the cattle of Thespios,

43
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,830
king of Thespiae.

44
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:35,099
When Herakles catches it and slays it, Thespios
is so overjoyed that he allows him to take

45
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:38,519
one of his fifty daughters to bed each night.

46
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:40,019
[PAUSE] Gross..

47
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:43,950
Eventually, Alceides moves back to Thebes
and marries princess Megara.

48
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,010
They start a family, and things begin to settle
down.

49
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:53,110
Despite the earlier adventures, though, THIS
is where we get to the turning point in Alceides’

50
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,990
life: suddenly, he goes mad.

51
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:00,269
He takes his three children, and two of his
nephews, and burns them alive.

52
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:05,209
There is some ambiguity here in the story,
whether this madness was Alceides finally

53
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:10,610
giving in to his wild nature, or whether it
was caused by a vindictive Hera, who can really

54
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,610
hold a grudge.

55
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:16,599
But either way - when Alceides comes to his
senses he implores an oracle for help.

56
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:20,079
The oracle tells him ‒ appease Hera.

57
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:22,340
Change your name to Herakles.

58
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:28,689
And to atone you must travel to Tiryns, and
allow your rival, King Eurystheus, king of

59
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:34,209
Tiryns and Mycenae, to set your punishment
for killing your children.

60
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:38,170
This is the beginning of the ten labors of
Herakles.

61
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,170
Yup, ten.

62
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,170
Don’t worry.

63
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,170
We’re gonna get there.

64
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:44,329
When Herakles arrives and tells Eurystheus
what he’s done, the king of Tiryns gives

65
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:47,239
him a set of impossible tasks.

66
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:53,510
These ten labors will take Herakles far and
away, confronting all manner of monster.

67
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:58,599
And if he succeeds, he won’t just atone
for his family-murdering, he’ll also be

68
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:01,150
granted immortality.

69
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:06,819
These are the heroic tasks that made Herakles
famous, let’s count them off.

70
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:10,879
ONE - THE NEMEAN LION
Harkening back to his days as a lion-slaying

71
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,550
shepherd, Herakles’ first labor is to go
to Nemea and kill a monstrous lion.

72
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:21,390
This lion’s skin can’t be pierced by arrows
or spears but Herakles doesn’t let this

73
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:26,110
stop him ‒ he puts the beast into a chokehold
and strangles him.

74
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,110
CHECK!

75
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:32,780
Herakles must then defeat the Lernean Hydra,
a swamp dragon with nine heads.

76
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,910
Everytime he slices one of the heads off,
two grow back in its place and before long

77
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,570
Herakles is practically drowning in craniums.

78
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:46,570
Luckily, his nephew Iolas (who somehow managed
to avoid the nephew killing-by-fire from earlier),

79
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,920
brings Herakles flaming torches.

80
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:54,410
The torches cauterize the dragon-neck-wounds,
preventing the hydra from multiplying.

81
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:59,130
Herakles kills the Hydra, dips some arrows
into its bile, y’know: just in case, and

82
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,820
returns triumphant.

83
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:08,080
But, Eurystheus tells him: this isn’t Herakles
and Iolas’ ten labors ‒ you can’t get

84
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,570
outside help.

85
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,040
That one doesn’t count.

86
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,490
Second labor: DISQUALIFIED.

87
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:18,730
For his third labor, Herakles must capture
the gold-horned Hind of Ceryneia.

88
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,730
ALONE.

89
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:25,500
It’s tough, but after some chasing or trapping
(depending on which version you prefer), Herakles

90
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,100
snags the Hind.

91
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,100
CHECK!

92
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,860
Next, Herakles must go to Psophis and kill
the giant Erymanthian Boar.

93
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,660
On the way he stops at the cave of the centaur
Pholos and ... accidentally kills him with

94
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,260
one of those Hydra-bile soaked just-in-case
arrows.

95
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:44,760
After burying the centaur, Herakles traps
the Boar and takes it to Mycenae.

96
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,940
CHECK! but also rest in power Pholos.

97
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:52,870
So far, all of Herakles’ labors have been
giant scary beast related.

98
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:58,930
For this fifth labor, Eurystheus tells him
he must ... clean out the stables.

99
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,350
Of Augeus, King of Elis.

100
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:08,110
Augeus owned 3,000 immortal cattle and hadn’t
cleaned his stables in 30 years.

101
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:13,930
Thats’ about 650,000 pounds of immortal
dung.

102
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,130
YEAH WE DID THE MATH.

103
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:20,560
Herakles agrees, and says to Augeus ‒ “If
I manage to clean all this out in a single

104
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,800
day, will you agree to give me a tenth of
your immortal cattle?”

105
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,970
OOOOOO TRICKY HERAKLES IS BACK
Augeus agrees, and instead of grabbing a dung

106
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:35,730
shovel, Herakles goes upstream and diverts
two nearby rivers through the stables.

107
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:39,730
The water washes out the years of dung in
minutes.

108
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:44,790
Augeus, who thought this labor was impossible,
bails on their deal . Herakles takes him before

109
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,640
a judge and wins the case.

110
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,980
But, Augeus flies into a rage and banishes
him before Herakles can claim the cattle.

111
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,520
Herakles returns to Eurystheus empty-handed,
only to have Eurystheus announce that this

112
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,780
labor didn’t count because Herakles tried
to get paid for it!

113
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,030
Fifth labor: DISQUALIFIED!

114
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:07,020
After the immortal-dung-debacle, Herakles
is back to wrangling monstrous animals.

115
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:12,250
This time, in Arcadia where he must drive
away the Stymphalian birds.

116
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,660
Herakles scares ‘em off with just a pair
of bronze castanets.

117
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,850
Sixth labor: CHECK.

118
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,850
Easy peasy.

119
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,030
Birds hate castanets!

120
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:22,300
[[THOTH SHOWS UP WITH CASTANETS, DRESSED AS
A FLAMENCO DANCER]]C’mon Thoth - you’re

121
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,050
an Ibis… not a FLAMENCO.

122
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:29,670
Herakle’s seventh labor is to capture the
rampaging Cretan Bull.

123
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:32,050
Which he could do this in his sleep at this
point.

124
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,060
Seventh labor: no sweat CHECK!.

125
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:38,940
Next , Herakles has to go to Thrace to capture
the man-eating mares of Diomedes.

126
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,780
There’s a lot of different versions of this
one, but they all end the same way...

127
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,620
Eighth labor: CHECK!

128
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:49,710
Herakles’ ninth labor is to fetch the belt
of Hippolyte, queen of the Amazons.

129
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:53,220
At first, Hippolyte agrees to just give Herakles
the belt.

130
00:07:53,220 --> 00:08:01,160
But then Hera starts a rumor that Herakles
has come to kidnap Hippolyte, and the Amazons

131
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,160
jump him.

132
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,320
In the ensuing struggle, Herakles kills Hippolyte
and takes her belt.

133
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,340
Ninth labor: CHECK!.

134
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,710
Hippolyte, we barely knew thee.

135
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:16,030
Just one labor left, but there were two disqualifications!

136
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,490
For Herakles’ final three labors, let’s
go to the Thought Bubble:

137
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:24,470
The tenth labor takes Herakles far to the
west, to Erytheia, where he must seize the

138
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,590
red cattle of Geryon.

139
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:32,779
On the way, Herakles is so angry about how
hot the Sun is that he aims his bow and arrow

140
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:33,779
at it.

141
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:39,049
The Sun is so impressed with Herakles’ bravery
that he gives the hero a golden cup.

142
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:40,518
And not just any cup.

143
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,750
A magic cup!

144
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,619
That’s also a ship.

145
00:08:43,619 --> 00:08:48,800
After Herakles kills Geryon and his herdsman
and his two-headed guard dog, he uses the

146
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,430
cup to transport the cattle back across the
sea.

147
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:55,389
But then they escape and he has to chase them
all over Europe.

148
00:08:55,389 --> 00:09:01,480
When Herakles finally gets them to Eurystheus,
the king sacrifices them to Hera–thats labor

149
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,410
ten CHECK!–and tells Herakles ‒ okay,
you screwed up twice.

150
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,410
Here are your two make up labors.

151
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:12,930
Labor eleven is collecting golden Apples from
the nymphs, the Hesperides.

152
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,260
This is the one where he tricks Atlas into
helping him.

153
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,279
He also frees Prometheus.

154
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:17,810
You how this turns out: CH-CH-CH-CHECK!

155
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:22,560
And the twelfth, and final labor is to travel
to the Underworld and bring back that damned

156
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,470
doggo Cerberos, Hades’ three headed guard
pup.

157
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:30,930
Herakles travels to the land of the dead,
where Hades happens upon Herakles and tells

158
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:36,620
him ‒ you can have Cerberos, but only if
you can defeat him without any of the weapons

159
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,930
you’ve brought.

160
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:42,480
Herakles agrees, snags Cerberos around the
neck and chokes him into submission.

161
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,430
He drags the dog to Eurystheus, gets him to
sign off on the final labor––CHECK TO

162
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,730
END ALL CHECKS and then returns Cerberos to
Hades.

163
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:51,730
Good boy, Cerberos.

164
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:52,730
And nice work Herakles.

165
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:53,730
Thanks Thoughtbubble.

166
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:58,050
After all that adventuring, Herakles manages
to complete his ten-turned-twelve labors.

167
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,990
While this is Herakles’ most famous story,
it’s far from his last adventure.

168
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,110
He gets married again.

169
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,259
That’s right…no happily ever after with
Megara.

170
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:07,720
Disney lied to you.

171
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,970
Eventually, he even manages to achieve that
elusive immortality.

172
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,490
Though, at a great cost.

173
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:17,730
Well after his twelve labors, Herakles is
crossing the river Evenus with his new wife

174
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:18,790
Deianeira.

175
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:25,160
The ferryman, a centaur named Nessus, tries
to rape Deianeira midstream and Herakles kills

176
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,160
him.

177
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,439
But with his dying breath, Nessus tricks Deianeira
into preparing what he tells her is a love

178
00:10:31,439 --> 00:10:35,740
potion that she can use if Herakles ever loses
interest in her.

179
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,230
Sure enough, Herakles later falls in love
with Iole.

180
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:44,449
In order to win him back, Deianeira soaks
his shirt in Nessus’ “love potion” AKA

181
00:10:44,449 --> 00:10:48,720
and of course a horrible, horrible poison
because what else would it be NESSUS WAS CLEARLY

182
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,960
A BAD GUY.

183
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:55,670
Herakles puts on the shirt, and dies an extremely
painful death, burning on his own funeral

184
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,670
pyre.

185
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:02,980
Finally Zeus tells Hera, hey, enough is enough
and sends Athena down to make Herakles immortal

186
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,920
and bring him to Mount Olympus.

187
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,139
So Herakles becomes a god and gets to live
on Olympus.

188
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:10,319
Right near Hera.

189
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:11,319
… Yay?

190
00:11:11,319 --> 00:11:16,050
So... what makes Herakles, a screw up and
a child murderer, such an enduring hero?

191
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:20,550
I mean as demi-gods go, the guy isn’t exactly
a role model.

192
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,550
He sleeps around.

193
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,880
He loses his temper and kills people.

194
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,779
The ancient world seemed to love him for the
variety and excitement of his adventures.

195
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:31,819
But what do we do about Herakles today?

196
00:11:31,819 --> 00:11:34,519
Herakles presents a real problem.

197
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:39,870
He’s been given power and strength and brains,
all courtesy of creepy, absent, irresponsible

198
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:43,670
father, but he still has to struggle to live
an ethical life?

199
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,570
Maybe we don’t have to fight hydras.

200
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:46,930
I hope we don’t.

201
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,060
Well, I definitely hope I don’t.

202
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:53,930
Yet we all have to work to try and live with
each other respectfully and responsibly.

203
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:57,310
We can’t rock a lion skin, but maybe we
can rock that.

204
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:24,379
See you next time for the last in our hero
series - about Ma’ui.

205
00:12:24,379 --> 00:00:00,000
You’re welcome.
