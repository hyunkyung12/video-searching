00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,080
Hi, I’m Mike Rugnetta, this is Crashcourse
Mythology and today we’re talking about

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,030
a hero myth from Africa. It’s got everything
– water serpents, a brag

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:13,630
aby, banana beer, a murder scepter, and the
worst dad in the world. Even worse than Saturn

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:23,000
– who ate his children! Join Thoth and I
for a look at the Epic of Mwindo.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,539
[Intro]
The Mwindo story comes from the Nyanga people

6
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:36,050
of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Like
all myths, the story has changed from telling

7
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:41,680
to telling. But in every version, Mwindo rises
from an auspicious birth to become chief of

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,890
his people, facing danger and defeating villains
along the way. The version we’ll discuss

9
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,190
comes from a storyteller of the oral tradition:
Candi Rureke.

10
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:56,100
Before we get too far, a quick note on our
favorite meta-topic: pronunciation. I briefly

11
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,410
wanna confront not only … the difficulty
I’m gonna have nailing some of these pronunciations,

12
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:06,770
but what might be indicated by the relative
absence, on the internet at least, of pronunciation

13
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:10,040
guides for stories from this part of the world.

14
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,219
We asked you, our audience, to help with pronunciation
for this episode, and others yet to come.

15
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:21,869
It was A HUGE HELP, but still if I say something
that sounds wrong, please write a comment,

16
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:28,859
but also go to forvo.com and record the correct
pronunciation so it’s out there in the world

17
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:29,859
for everyone!

18
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:35,250
Ok - enough talk-talk … on with the show.
Mwindo’s story begins before he’s even

19
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:41,139
born. His father, Shemwindo, the chief of
Tubondo has seven wives and swears that he

20
00:01:41,139 --> 00:01:48,780
will kill any woman who bears him a son. He
wants daughters who will bring dowry money.

21
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,909
This is bad news for Mwindo’s mom – because
he’s a boy!

22
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:57,549
But, luckily they have some help, since Nyanga
children receive guidance and protection from

23
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:04,109
their aunts, and Mwindo’s Aunt Iyangura
is pretty rad. Iyangura isn’t only strong,

24
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:09,229
beautiful, and clever, she’s also married
to Mukiti, the water serpent, who also has

25
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,930
special influence over bats and spiders.
You might remember the tale of baby Hermes,

26
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:19,760
who could walk and talk and make mischief
the moment he was born. Well, Mwindo one ups

27
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,170
him. He helps his mother collect firewood
and food... while he’s still in the womb!

28
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:30,319
He’s born by leaping out of his mother’s
middle, making all the midwives and obstetricians

29
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:36,340
yell: “What kind of child is that?”[1]
Mwindo is born holding an axe, a magical bag,

30
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:43,060
a magic rope and most importantly: a magic
conga scepter–it’s kind of like a fly-swatter–made

31
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:48,560
of an antelope tail.
Shemwindo isn’t happy that Mwindo is a boy.

32
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,590
First he goes to Mwindo’s house and throws
spear after spear into the walls, trying to

33
00:02:53,590 --> 00:03:01,090
kill his only son. When Mwindo emerges unscathed,
Shemwindo grabs him and buries him alive.

34
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:07,530
But Mwindo, who can speak even though he’s
a baby, curses his father the whole way down,

35
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:14,249
and then just claws his way out of the grave.
Finally, Shemwindo grabs Mwindo and sews him

36
00:03:14,249 --> 00:03:20,640
up into a drum which he throws into a lake!
The sky rumbles and it rains for seven days,

37
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,530
and the whole village suffers a famine. Methinks
this does not bode well for Shemwindo.

38
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:31,560
Sitting underwater, still sewn into a drum,
and definitely not drowning, Mwindo decides

39
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,680
it’s time to beat a hasty retreat. He starts
to roll the drum up the river to find aunt

40
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,329
Iyangura (remember, she lives with the water
serpent). Along the way, he defeats a bunch

41
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:45,860
of water creatures by singing to them, and
spends his time boasting, calling himself

42
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:52,079
“Little one Just Born He Walked.” When
he reaches his aunt, she slices him out of

43
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:55,029
the drum.
Iyangura serves many roles in Mwindo’s story.

44
00:03:55,029 --> 00:03:59,120
She’s a strong mother figure, and advice
giving goddess, a role you’ll remember from

45
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,109
Joseph Campbell’s theory of the hero’s
journey featured in episode twenty-five. Iyangura

46
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:09,569
also sets Mwindo on his quest. She tells him
that even though Shemwindo is the worst dad

47
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:15,920
in the world, Mwindo can’t get revenge on
his own. “The lonely path is never a pleasant

48
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,390
one to travel,” she tells him.[2] That’s
why I’m glad we’re in this together, Thoth.

49
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:25,961
Huh? Oh - yeah, also you guys are cool!
Mwindo listens to Iyangura, but can’t help

50
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:32,740
himself from messing with his dad. So he begins
singing a long, magical song that calls all

51
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:38,090
his father’s possessions in Tubondo to come,
and be his.

52
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,490
Mwindo might have felt clever for stealing
his dad’s stuff, but it doesn’t work out

53
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:47,060
that well because Mwindo’s followers are
gluttons, who gorge themselves on newly arrived

54
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:52,340
food and get sick.. Mwindo can’t believe
this – he’s about to lead all these greedy

55
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:57,479
guts into battle – so he calls on Nkuba,
the god of lightning, to help him.

56
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:03,479
Nkuba destroys Tubondo with seven lightning
flashes, turning the village and its residents

57
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:09,280
to dust, which is maybe a bit drastic. But,
Shemwindo finally gets the message: messing

58
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,860
with Mwindo is a bad idea. He flees to an
underground lair.

59
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,990
But Mwindo doesn’t let his dad get away
that easy. First, he brings all of his uncles

60
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:25,430
who died in Tubondo back to life and commands
them to forge him baby-armor. Mwindo sets

61
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:29,940
out... and follows his father’s trail to
the underworld. We’re gonna follow with

62
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:34,060
him in the Thoughtbubble.
Underground, Mwindo meets Kahindo. She’s

63
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:40,879
a goddess of good fortune, but her dad is
Muisa, god of the underworld. Kahindo tells

64
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:47,490
Mwindo that Muisa is protecting Shemwindo.
But luckily, she hates her dad so much...

65
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:54,729
she agrees to tell Mwindo–step by step–what
he has to do defeat Muisa, and find his pops.

66
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:58,639
First, she says, my dad’s gonna offer you
banana beer, but don’t drink that banana

67
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,949
beer, because it’s actually pee. Gross.
Second, my dad’s gonna offer you banana

68
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:07,979
paste, but don’t eat that banana paste,
because it’s actually poo. Even grosser.

69
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:13,530
Then, after you don’t eat his snacks, he’ll
ask you to pass his tests...and at that point,

70
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:16,900
you’re on your own.
Mwindo tracks down Muisa, and it’s exactly

71
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:23,650
as Kahindo said, and Muisa gives him a test:
cultivate a new, actual banana grove in the

72
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:30,009
underworld. Mwindo uses a magic billhook that
tills the field and plants the seeds and harvests

73
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:34,780
the bananas all by itself.
Muisa unwinds his magical cowrie belt and

74
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:41,909
gives it an order: fly and kill Mwindo. The
belt zips off, finds Mwindo and kills him.

75
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:46,040
End of story, thanks for watching. MIKE TAKES
OUT HIS PHONE Thanks Thought Bubble. Usual

76
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:54,419
for lunch, Thoth? Shrimp? Crab cakes?
Just kidding. Back to the Thought Bubble.

77
00:06:54,419 --> 00:07:00,349
As soon as Mwindo falls, his magic scepter
brings him back to life. I told you that thing

78
00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:05,860
was important. Mwindo grabs the scepter and
sends it to go kill Muisa. The scepter flies

79
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:12,750
to Muisa and kills the god of the underworld!
And then...brings him back to life. That magical

80
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,379
autonomous murder-and-rebirth scepter REALLY
has a mind of its own.

81
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:21,189
Thanks for real Thoughtbubble. After the Battle
of Enchanted Accessories™, Mwindo completes

82
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:25,389
more of Muisa’s tests, Muisa makes some
more assassination attempts.

83
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:29,319
Eventually, Mwindo gets fed up with all the
testing and belt attacking and confronts Muisa

84
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:37,220
directly. “Give me my dad. I know you’re
hiding him.” Muisa refuses, and Mwindo kills

85
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,860
him once and for all, and keeps tracking.
Shemwindo’s tracks eventually end in the

86
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:48,190
home of Sheburu-wngu – the god of all creation.
Mwindo demands to know where his dad is, but

87
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:54,879
Sheburungu says that if Mwindo wants his help,
he’ll have to best him in a game of wiki.

88
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,289
In this game, the players take turns editing
the entries for celebrities to include funny

89
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:03,730
false details and the edit that lasts the
longest...OK JUST KIDDING BUT I KINDA HAD

90
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:06,129
TO RIGHT?
Seriously tho, in this case, a game of “wiki”

91
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:11,550
means guessing the number of black seeds held
in your opponent's hand. Mwindo agrees, and

92
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:16,909
the baby and the god start to play.
At first, Sheburungu beats Mwindo over and

93
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:23,780
over again, winning everything Mwindo owns
except his magic scepter. With his back to

94
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:30,659
the wall, Mwindo bets his scepter and begins
to win. Wager after wager, guess after guess,

95
00:08:30,659 --> 00:08:37,450
Mwindo cleans Sheburungu’s clock until he
wins all of Sheburungu's possessions. Including,

96
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:41,970
probably, his newly cleaned clock.
But Mwindo tells Sheburungu: I don’t want

97
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:48,400
your things, I don’t want creation, I just
want you to hand over my dad. Sheburungu has

98
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:55,960
to agree, and so Mwindo returns to Tubondo
with a captured Shemwindo. This is Mwindo’s

99
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,520
turning point, when the boastful baby gets
the chance to face his father. Instead of

100
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:07,010
killing him, Mwindo is magnanimous, and pardons
Shemwindo for his past mistakes.

101
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:12,420
Flush with mercy, he even brings Muisa back
to life - who offers his daughter Kahindo’s

102
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:18,270
hand in marriage. Mwindo refuses, saying he
wants to marry in Tubondo. This is going to

103
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:24,860
be a little tough, since Nkuba lightning zapped
everyone in Tubondo. So Mwindo revives them

104
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:30,640
too, bringing the whole village back to life.
Finally, Shemwindo admits to the village that

105
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,490
he was wrong to try to kill Mwindo and that
he’s sorry about that whole drowning in

106
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:41,790
a drum thing: “So may the male offspring
be spared,” he said, “for he has shown

107
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:47,390
me the way in which the sky becomes daylight
and has given me the joy of witnessing again

108
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:53,140
the warmth of the people and of all the things
here in Tubondo.” Mwindo replies: “I will

109
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:58,060
not hold a grudge against my father … What
my father did against me and what I did against

110
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:02,410
my father, all that is already over.”
Mwindo’s story doesn’t end here, though

111
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:07,440
– in his subsequent adventures he learns,
often the hard way, how to be a compassionate,

112
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:14,700
and respectful ruler. Mwindo thus returns
to his people, wiser and fit to rule. He pronounces

113
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,770
a blessing that establishes rules by which
to live:

114
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:23,100
May you grow many foods and many crops
May you live in good houses

115
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,880
May you moreover live in a beautiful village.
Don’t quarrel with one another.

116
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:33,830
Don’t pursue another’s space
Don’t mock the invalid passing in the village.

117
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:38,110
And he who seduces another’s wife will be
killed

118
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:42,360
Accept the chief. Fear him. May he also fear
you.

119
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:48,690
May you agree with one another, all together,
No enmity in the land nor too much hate.

120
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,160
May you bring forth tall and short children
–

121
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,750
In so doing you will bring them forth for
the chief.

122
00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:01,450
So Mwindo has really grown up. His hero’s
journey took him from braggy baby to a just

123
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:06,440
ruler, fairly governing his people.
At its heart, the Mwindo story is a Freudian-style

124
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,210
conflict of a boy maturing to take his father’s
place. Take out the magical murder scepter

125
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:15,910
and the other supernatural parts and maybe
some of the more draconian rules, and it’s

126
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:21,000
also a model for an individual’s journey
from boastful child to wise ruler. And it

127
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,420
teaches us why we should never ever take banana
paste from a stranger.

128
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:30,710
Mwindo shows us how an individual must mature
to become truly heroic, and also fulfills

129
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:35,810
an etiological role for the Nyanga people:
he re-establishes their village. He provides

130
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:41,840
the model of forgiveness and shows how a chief
must be powerful and also favored by the gods.

131
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,590
He demonstrates that even with auspicious
beginnings and divine help, heroes are flawed

132
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:58,500
and only achieve success if they learn and
grow. Thanks for watching. See you next time.
