00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
Hi, there. I'm Mike Rugnetta. This is Crash Course Mythology, and today we're going to start the first of a few episodes

2
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:09,779
a show favorite: trickster stories, but be warned, trickster

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:16,440
myths can get sexy, a little gross, and they're filled with betrayal, but we should be able to handle it, right Thoth?

4
00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:18,910
Oh, hmm...

5
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:26,639
Oh, Thoth, Stan just texted me. You've been promoted to host. So, uh, I'm just going to go grab a coffee. See you later

6
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,679
Good luck.

7
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,679
[Intro]

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,779
Just kidding. There's no way that Thoth could host the show.

9
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,239
He's like thousands of years old and he only speaks Ancient Egyptian which literally no one understands.

10
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:54,119
But roping some sucker into doing my work is exactly the sort of thing a trickster would do.

11
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,820
Trickster stories are traditionally very popular, and for a good reason:

12
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,460
In many trickster stories the underdogs come out on top, and not by virtue of their...

13
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,560
superior strength or immortal attributes either, but because of their smarts.

14
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:14,220
Another appealing thing about tricksters Is that they're transgressive. They're rebels and who doesn't love a rebel? Just ask Ares, Greek

15
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,040
God of War and Rebellion or James Dean the American God of pomade and leather jackets.

16
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,380
A good place to start is mythologist David Leeming's description of a trickster:

17
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,040
so a moral and scatological, but otherwise a good guy. We all have that friend, I think.

18
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:59,300
Let's begin in Africa. African Trickster stories remain popular and frequently have ambiguous or morally dubious endings.

19
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,060
According to Thury and Devinny,

20
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,820
So let's see exactly what they mean by "disharmony" in the Thought Bubble.

21
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:16,320
Anansi the spider and his son [] are farmers having a bad year because of a drought.

22
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:22,860
One day [] is out for a walk lamenting the poor harvest and he sees a hunchback dwarf by the side of the road.

23
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,500
The dwarf asks [] what's wrong, and when he explains the dwarf promises to help.

24
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:34,860
He tells [] to find two small sticks and tap him lightly on his hump while singing. So, tap tap, and it begins to rain.

25
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:42,149
Soon the crops start growing. Anansi thinks he can do better and goes to look for the dwarf himself, making sure to bring two big sticks.

26
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:46,589
The dwarf tells Anansi to tap him on his hump again,

27
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,090
but Anansi ends up hitting the dwarf so hard that he kills him.

28
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,300
Now, Anansi is scared because the dwarf was the King's favorite jester.

29
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,260
So he puts the dwarf's body in a kola tree and waits.

30
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,330
When his son [] come by and asks his father if he'd seen the dwarf,

31
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,480
Anansi tells him that the dwarf is climbing the tree looking for a kola nut.

32
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,020
The quicken sin climbs up the tree the dwarf's body falls down to the ground

33
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:20,620
Anansi cries out that "his son had killed the King's jester!" But [] knows Anansi's tricks and replies that the King was

34
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,410
actually angry with the dwarf and now he could go to the king and collect a reward.

35
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:29,669
Knowing there's a bounty Anansi exclaims that he had killed the dwarf.

36
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:35,070
Anansi arrives at the Kings court and discovers the King was not angry with the Jester.

37
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:43,880
But now he's certainly angry with Anansi. The king orders the body of the dwarf to be put in a box which Anansi must carry

38
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:49,360
on his head forever unless he finds someone else to carry it.

39
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:55,529
Eventually, Anansi comes across Ant and asks him to hold the box while he goes to the market, and, wouldn't you know it, Ant falls for it?

40
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,839
This is why to this day we often see ants carrying great burden. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

41
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:06,119
It's probably becoming clear. Why you know a lot of us just don't trust spiders.

42
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,640
In a number of ways, this is a classic African Trickster story.

43
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,360
It features animals with human characteristics interacting in a human world

44
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,200
The Trickster is initially undone by his own greed.

45
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:21,559
If Anansi had just listened to his son and not tried to outdo him, he would have been okay.

46
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,049
Also, maybe he shouldn't have tried to frame his son for a murder.

47
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:30,289
But Anansi fails in his attempt to hide his crime because his son knows his reputation for duplicity.

48
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,320
Despite his cleverness Anansi's greed gets the better of him.

49
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,800
His desire for the reward leads him to admit his bad deed and be punished for it.

50
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,500
And if he did end up carrying the coffin for eternity, the story might provide a lesson about justice,

51
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,340
but Anansi, being a trickster, is able to convince someone else to bear his burden.

52
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,560
So he gets off scot-free. The ending of the story does explain a natural phenomenon

53
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:55,520
(why ants are so industrious),

54
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:02,160
but the story isn't exactly a model for good behavior. In the end Anansi gets away with killing the dwarf.

55
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,440
His comeuppance is brief and the only thing he learns is that ants are total suckers.

56
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,800
It's really like a Quentin Tarantino film of trickster myths.

57
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,880
The story of Anansi and the Ant bears some resemblance to one of Hercules's labors.

58
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:16,878
We'll talk more about Hercules when we get to our episode on heroes,

59
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,920
but the long and short is that he had to do twelve labors, and completing them cemented his reputation.

60
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:29,100
One of these labours, the eleventh, was to gather Zeus's Golden Apples from the far end of the Earth.

61
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,940
These apples were guarded by a dragon (Ladon) and the Hesperides,

62
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,340
nymphs who were the daughters of Atlas, the Titan with the unenviable task of holding the world on his shoulders.

63
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,800
Talk about legendary back pain.

64
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,380
It took a long time and a number of adventures before Hercules even found out where the apples were,

65
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:51,400
but eventually he is told about them by another trickster, Prometheus.

66
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:56,060
You remember him, he's the guy who stole fire for the Humans and was punished by being chained to a rock

67
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,340
and having his liver eaten daily by an eagle.

68
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:04,159
Well good news, eventually Hercules kills that eagle and in return Prometheus tells him

69
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:07,639
that the way to get the apples isn't to fight a dragon, but to simply ask Atlas.

70
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:13,849
Atlas can easily get past his daughters and that Mr. Dragon. No sweat.

71
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:19,969
So hercules makes a deal with Atlas hercules will hold up the world giving Atlas a much-needed break and in return, apples.

72
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,520
Atlas is thrilled because I mean think about it, how would you feel holding up the literal world all the time?

73
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,040
So he leaves, he goes he grabs the apples.

74
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:34,819
The problem is that when he returns he tells Hercules that he really doesn't want to hold up the earth and the sky anymore.

75
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:41,080
So like maybe that's just your job now Hercules. I don't know, just spit balling here.

76
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:47,340
So here's Hercules, he can't move, he's holding the world after all, but he does some quick tricky thinking.

77
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:56,520
He tells Atlas "Sure, he'll do it", but could atlas take the Earth and Sky back for just a second while he gets some padding for his shoulders?

78
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,140
And when Atlas agrees, Hercules grabs the apples and vamooses.

79
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,320
Tricksters tricking tricksters. Kind of like [???].

80
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:09,980
In these stories, we see that it often doesn't take much for a trickster to figure out how to fool the object of his trick, sometimes called a dupe.

81
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:14,580
Often the dupe doesn't really deserve it, although it's hard to feel sorry for Atlas,

82
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,120
who was attempting some minor league trickstering himself.

83
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,700
While tricksters can be seen as playful scamps, they also show us that play can be dangerous,

84
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,660
especially, when like Anansi, we let it go too far.

85
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,100
in the Anansi story, the trickster acts as what Leonard and McClure call a moral counterexample.

86
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:54,500
We're usually better off when we don't lie or cheat each other, but that's exactly what tricksters do.

87
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,020
We're typically happy when they're punished for their tricks, but this doesn't always happen.

88
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:05,980
Trickster stories can be especially troubling because not only do they usually get away with their tricks, but are often celebrated for it.

89
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:13,880
Tricksters aren't all bad, though. The trickster can provide a model for the oppressed to reclaim some autonomy in the face of overwhelming power.

90
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:19,080
This is one of the main lessons of the Br'er rabbit stories which are descended from African Trickster stories,

91
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:24,240
but transplanted into the context of chattel slavery in English-speaking North America.

92
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,780
Br'er can be seen as representing slaves who would use their ingenuity to fort and outsmart cruel plantation owners

93
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:35,900
Maybe then, it's worth asking what would happen if the tricksters just always won.

94
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:41,490
And the truth is while some tricksterism may be justified and a little bit of transgression here and there is fun,

95
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:49,060
if everyone decides that it's okay to beat dwarves to death in order to double the amount of rainfall, metaphorically speaking, that wouldn't be great.

96
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,640
Trickster stories are often morally ambiguous in this way.

97
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,220
Even Br'er rabbit isn't all clearly the good guy, and that's one part of why we like them so much, maybe.

98
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:05,060
Sometimes it's simply a thrill to break the rules. We as human can see ourselves pretty clearly in the trickster myths.

99
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:10,880
It's hard to identify with someone who can hold the world or who goes on errands for the father of creation,

100
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,480
but we've all at least tried our hand.

101
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,840
Bamboozling someone into taking over our responsibility. Sorry Thoth, you're a good sport.

102
00:09:19,840 --> 00:00:00,000
Thanks for watching, we'll see everyone next week.
