1
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,830
These days, you might turn on the TV and think
you’d been transported to a movie theater.

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,840
Oscar-winning movie stars are all over television
shows,

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,340
Directors known for big screen blockbusters,
like David Fincher and Martin Scorsese, have

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,010
found success working in television.

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,090
And the advent of streaming services and premium
cable networks have expanded not only how

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,980
we watch shows, but also the kinds of shows
that get produced.

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,320
Edgier content that used to be reserved for
feature films is now being explored every

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,320
day on TV.

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,470
As the line between cinema and television
continues to blur, no discussion of film production

10
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:34,300
would be complete without tackling the TV
landscape and how television production has

11
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,720
come to look a lot like making movies.

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:49,120
[Opening Music Plays]

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:55,860
Television includes a huge variety of content that can be broken down into a bunch of different
categories, from prestige dramas and traditional

14
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:59,430
sitcoms, to infomercials, soap operas, and
24-hour news networks.

15
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,520
One of the most basic ways to categorize TV
shows is to divide up scripted and unscripted

16
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,519
content.

17
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,329
Scripted TV simply means there was a script
written for the show.

18
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:11,460
So that’s everything from Game of Thrones
and Empire to Family Ties and Quantum Leap.

19
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,980
Unscripted TV is – you guessed it – any
show made without a script.

20
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:19,040
This can include reality TV, like The Bachelor
or House Hunters, as well as sports games,

21
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:20,329
awards shows, and cable news.

22
00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:23,899
Today we’ll talk about scripted TV, since
that’s closest to film.

23
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:26,740
We’re also going to focus on television
in the United States.

24
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,719
We’d be here all day if we dove into how
other countries produce and monetize TV shows!

25
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,599
Now, television can also be broken down in
terms of how it’s delivered to the audience,

26
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:37,799
which has a major impact in how the money
is made and what shows make it onto the air.

27
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,420
The four main kinds of contemporary TV networks
are broadcast networks, basic cable, premium

28
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,099
cable, and streaming services.

29
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:49,189
Today, there are five major broadcast networks
in the United States: NBC, CBS, ABC, Fox,

30
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:51,140
and The CW.

31
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,799
There are a handful of other ones, like PBS, which offer

32
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:57,229
more specialized programming and operate under
different economic models.

33
00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:01,669
But these five major broadcast networks make
most of their money through on-air advertising

34
00:02:01,669 --> 00:02:06,439
– things like restaurant commercials, pharmaceutical
ads, or geckos selling you car insurance.

35
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:10,619
So broadcast networks want to reach as many
eyeballs as possible, by making their shows

36
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:11,619
widely appealing.

37
00:02:11,619 --> 00:02:16,070
A season is traditionally a year’s worth
of episodes – often 22 for broadcast network

38
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,010
dramas and sitcoms, and more like 8 to 12
on cable.

39
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,790
And if networks cram more episodes into each
season, they can sell more commercial blocks.

40
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:27,420
Which is why NCIS runs for 22 episodes a season
on CBS, and has since 2003!

41
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,701
The more people watching a network’s shows,
the more money advertisers will pay, which

42
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:34,450
is why ratings matter to broadcast networks.

43
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,730
Ratings are a measurement of how many viewers
watch each episode of television.

44
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:41,400
In the United States, the Nielsen Research
Media rating system has become the industry

45
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,079
standard for figuring out how popular a show
is.

46
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:48,670
Nielsen ratings rely on complex statistical
sampling, the same technique used for predicting

47
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,340
the outcome of political elections.

48
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,409
The Nielsen team monitors the TV viewing habits
of a sample of American households, and then

49
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:57,739
extrapolates from those numbers to arrive
at a rating for each episode.

50
00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:01,680
Among the various problems with this system,
the sample size is really small.

51
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,370
Something like 5,000 households are used to
determine the entire nation’s viewing habits.

52
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,840
Also, the advent of DVRs has made collecting
reliable viewership data trickier, because

53
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,230
lots of people record shows and watch them
later.

54
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:15,530
Officially, Nielsen Research Media counts
DVR numbers in a show’s rating if the episode

55
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,569
is watched within one week of the original
air date.

56
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:22,879
But if you save up every episode of American
Horror Story to marathon in one terrifying

57
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,260
sitting, that doesn’t count.

58
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,439
Even with these flaws, broadcast networks
continue to use Nielsen ratings to decide

59
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:30,689
which shows get renewed and which get the
ax.

60
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:34,400
Basic cable networks operate similarly, but
don’t have as much pressure to reach a massive

61
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
audience.

62
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,540
These include all the channels you get with
the standard package from your cable company,

63
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:42,910
like TNT, USA, AMC, the Disney Channel, the
History Channel, and Sy-Fy…

64
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,249
Plus all those other channels you zip past
to get to your favorites.

65
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:50,060
Basic cable networks make money through on-air
advertising, like broadcast networks.

66
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,480
But they also charge a carriage fee to the
cable company that “carries” the network

67
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,480
into your home.

68
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,140
That means that basic cable shows can appeal
to a more niche audience, and still make a

69
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,140
profit.

70
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,930
Especially if that audience is likely to spend
money on high-end and luxury products.

71
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:06,859
So Mad Men was a hit for AMC, even though
only 2 million people watched it each week,

72
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:11,439
while each episode of The Big Bang Theory
reaches almost 20 million people for CBS.

73
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,108
Premium cable networks, like HBO, Showtime,
and Starz, abandon on-air advertising altogether,

74
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:20,038
and rely largely on monthly fees paid by each
viewing household for income.

75
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:24,220
So ratings matter much less for these channels,
and they measure success in other ways.

76
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,720
Game of Thrones and Girls aren’t expected
to draw 15 million viewers each week.

77
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,780
Instead, HBO hopes lopped-off heads and hilarious
20-somethings will create enough cultural

78
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,650
excitement that more people sign up for the
network.

79
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:40,789
Streaming services that produce original content,
like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu, also

80
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:42,139
rely on a subscription model.

81
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:46,320
A show like Transparent is a hit because it
makes more people pay for Amazon Prime, not

82
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,660
because it can compete with Quantico for viewers.

83
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,340
All these different kinds of networks matter
because they affect which shows get made,

84
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,980
how they’re produced, and what subject matter
they can tackle!

85
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,051
Since broadcast network shows need to appeal
to a wide audience to make money, premium

86
00:04:59,051 --> 00:05:04,099
cable and streaming series can tell more challenging
stories with higher levels of sexuality, violence,

87
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:05,099
and harsh language.

88
00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:08,610
That doesn’t make premium cable shows better,
but it certainly makes them different!

89
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:13,169
And just like film distribution went through
big changes after home video, video-on-demand,

90
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:17,220
and now streaming services, TV networks have
many ways to get their shows to an audience.

91
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,840
The old broadcast model used to rely on first-run
episodes followed by re-runs, where the network

92
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,270
would air old episodes of their own shows
later in the week or over the summer.

93
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:30,000
If a show was successful enough to run a hundred
episodes or so, it might be sold into syndication.

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,800
This is where the studio that actually made
the show starts licensing the existing seasons

95
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,750
directly to local TV affiliates.

96
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:40,479
These days, premium cable series sometimes
make the syndication leap to basic cable networks,

97
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,629
like when A&E bought the rights to air a slightly
tamer edit of The Sopranos, which originally

98
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:45,629
aired on HBO.

99
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:50,050
Premium cable channels like HBO and Showtime
have set up their own streaming services too.

100
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,970
That way, they can keep sole ownership of
their content and sometimes bypass cable companies

101
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:54,970
altogether.

102
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:59,360
Now, in many ways, producing scripted television
and making feature films are remarkably similar.

103
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,483
Writers write scripts, producers assemble
crews of cinematographers, gaffers, costume

104
00:06:02,483 --> 00:06:04,930
designers, and so on, directors oversee the
shooting of the scenes, and editors cut them

105
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:05,930
together.

106
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,889
In other ways, they’re fundamentally different.

107
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:10,729
Most obviously, TV series are way longer.

108
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:14,849
A show might run anywhere from 6 episodes
per season on premium cable, to a whopping

109
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:17,729
22 episodes per season on a broadcast network.

110
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:21,490
And super successful shows like Friends or
Grey’s Anatomy might keep airing for more

111
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,490
than a decade.

112
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:27,069
That’s a lot of story, which means a lot
of scripts, locations, characters, and shooting

113
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:30,539
days, which means more writers, producers,
actors, and crew.

114
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:31,710
And longer shooting schedules.

115
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:35,919
If film shoots are grueling, shooting a TV
series can be a full-on marathon!

116
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:41,080
Also, unlike feature films, the main creative
decision-maker on a TV series is a writer-producer

117
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,370
called a showrunner.

118
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:46,920
Very often, the showrunner is also the creator
of the series and the sole writer of the show’s

119
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,550
pilot, a test episode that helps the network
choose which series to make.

120
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,629
Showrunners can oversee everything from the
story direction and writing, to hiring directors,

121
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:56,360
and even editing the series.

122
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,240
Most shows have a writers room, where a group
of writers gather to outline and write the

123
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,240
series’ episodes.

124
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,240
On broadcast network shows, the writers room
may have as many as 15 or 20 people.

125
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,900
But for cable series, the writers room is
often much smaller.

126
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,409
One season of Game of Thrones is regularly
written by only three or four people.

127
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:11,590
And on rare occasions, a single writer may
be responsible for an entire season.

128
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,750
Michael Hirst writes every episode of Vikings.

129
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,750
And Nic Pizzolatto wrote the first two seasons
of True Detective.

130
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,520
When it comes time to film the show, most
series divide their episodes among a number

131
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,789
of different directors.

132
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:25,340
Usually, the director of the pilot helps set
the look and feel of the series, and stays

133
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:29,360
involved as a producer to make sure future
episodes remain true to the original vision.

134
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,159
On occasion, a season of a premium cable or
streaming series might all be directed by

135
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,389
one person.

136
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:38,089
Cary Fukunaga directed all eight episodes
of True Detective season one, giving that

137
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:41,150
story a cohesive quality that’s unusual
on television.

138
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:44,860
For actors, working on a TV series can be
a major commitment.

139
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,289
Most series are designed to last for several
seasons, so an actor might spend years playing

140
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:50,289
the same part.

141
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:53,819
That’s great for job security – something
many actors struggle with – but it can also

142
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:56,280
make an actor feel trapped in a role or a
show.

143
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,669
While film franchises do have recurring characters,
like Harry Potter, James Bond, or any of those

144
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:04,259
Fast and Furious drivers, they’re the exception
rather than the rule.

145
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:07,629
More and more, TV series are being produced
like feature films.

146
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:11,569
This is especially true for single-camera
shows – everything from comedies like Atlanta

147
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:16,360
or Master of None to mysteries like Castle,
sci-fi epics like The Expanse, or realistic

148
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,000
dramas like Friday Night Lights.

149
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,169
They look and feel like movies, as though
each scene is happening in an actual location

150
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,729
within the world of the story.

151
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:27,139
They also allow for more control over the
shooting and editing of the show.

152
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:30,669
Three-camera shows, on the other hand, are
about as far away from feature films as scripted

153
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:31,669
TV gets!

154
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:35,390
They’re almost always sitcoms, and often
performed on a stage in front of a “live”

155
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,390
studio audience.

156
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,780
Think of Cheers or The Big Bang Theory.

157
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:41,950
These shows look more artificial because…
well... they clearly are.

158
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:46,380
Multiple cameras capture the action, the sets
are designed to only be shot from one direction,

159
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:51,440
and the editing mixes mostly wide shots with
pre-recorded or enhanced laugh tracks.

160
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,840
They can be hysterically funny, but they don’t
seem that real.

161
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,470
Across different types of productions, more
actors, directors, writers, producers, and

162
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,910
crew members are working in both TV and
film.

163
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:07,030
We even have universes that crossover, thanks
to Marvel, and limited TV series like HBO’s

164
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,310
Big Little Lies that feel like extended movies.

165
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:13,840
It’s an exciting time to be involved in
both movies and TV, as an artist and a viewer,

166
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,460
where the only downside is there’s not enough
time to see it all!

167
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,290
Today we talked about the difference between
broadcast and cable networks, and how new

168
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,440
streaming services are changing the definition
of television.

169
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,730
We looked at how ratings impact what shows
make it to air, and how the subscriber model

170
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,810
of premium cable and the streaming services
allow them to make edgier shows.

171
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:35,650
And we discussed how TV shows are actually
made, from the power of the showrunner to

172
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,090
the difference between single camera and 3-camera
shows.

173
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:42,070
Next time, we’ll switch gears and start
watching and thinking critically about films

174
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,400
together, starting with Citizen Kane.

175
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,630
And you’ll be getting a brand new host:
Michael Aranda, who’s a very talented human

176
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:53,090
and has been working on Crash Course behind
the camera for years!

177
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:56,700
Crash Course Film Production is produced in
association with PBS Digital Studios.

178
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,321
You can head over to their channel to check
out a playlist of their latest shows, like

179
00:10:00,321 --> 00:10:04,090
The Art Assignment, Gross Science, and ACS
Reactions.

180
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:07,710
This episode of Crash Course was filmed in
the Doctor Cheryl C. Kinney Crash Course Studio

181
00:10:07,710 --> 00:00:00,000
with the help of these nice people and our
amazing graphics team is Thought Cafe.
