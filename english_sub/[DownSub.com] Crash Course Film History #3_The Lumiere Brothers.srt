00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,520
Hi. I'm the internet's Craig. This is Crash Course Film History.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,400
Based on what you’ve probably heard, or
read, or… what I told you last time, you’re

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,760
probably under the impression that the development
of modern film technology is all

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,980
thanks to famous inventor Thomas Edison,
and his less-than-famous employee, William Dickson.

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,040
You're wrong. I can't believe how wrong you are.

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,460
Together, these guys developed two of the

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,520
first commercially-viable film technologies:
the kinetograph – basically a camera – and

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,750
the kinetoscope – a single-viewer exhibition
device that you use to watch kinetograph films.

9
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:29,750
But guess what?

10
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:35,560
As was often the case with Edison, a lot of
the credit that’s given to him also belongs to a great many other people.

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,800
...not me.

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,660
While Edison and Dickson were setting out
to make moving pictures in New Jersey, lots

13
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,880
of other inventors were tinkering with film
technology across the world.

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,520
In Lyon, France, a pair of brothers saw the
kinetograph and kinetoscope – and said,

15
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,040
“We can do better than that!”

16
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,040
And they did.

17
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,090
Within two years, they invented a lightweight,
all-in-one motion picture device that made

18
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:53,510
movies and exhibited them.

19
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,540
They figured out a way to use the camera mechanism
to play back the developed roll of film, projecting

20
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,460
bright light through it to show images.

21
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:05,360
Films could be projected on an entire wall
or screen, letting audiences of people experience films, together... It'll never work.

22
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,940
By sheer coincidence – or maybe fate – their
surname means “light.”

23
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,040
Say hello to the Lumière Brothers and the
first projected films.

24
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:23,540
[Intro Music Plays]

25
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,820
Auguste and Louis Lumière were born in the 1860s in eastern France.

26
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,760
In 1870, their father moved the family to
Lyon and opened a small factory that made

27
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,760
photographic plates.

28
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,800
The family business, like all my businesses, teetered on the edge of bankruptcy, until the brothers took over.

29
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,860
They devised machines to help automate the
plant, and invented a new and improved photo plate.

30
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,700
By the time they started experimenting with
film technology, the Lumière Brothers had

31
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,979
lots of experience in business, engineering,
manufacturing, and photography.

32
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:51,810
They were intrigued by Edison’s motion picture
devices, but quickly saw the flaws: the camera

33
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,670
was hard to move, and only one person could
watch a film at a time.

34
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,050
So they went back to the basics, and made
a better camera.

35
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,729
Remember the intermittent stop-and-go mechanism
– how motion picture cameras need to stop

36
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:04,480
the film long enough to expose one frame to
light, before moving the roll to the next frame?

37
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,640
Well, the Lumière Brothers developed a device
around the stop-and-go mechanisms used in

38
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:09,649
sewing machines.

39
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:12,040
They weren’t the only ones tinkering with
this engineering problem, though.

40
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,299
Inventors were working independently all over
Europe and the United States, putting the

41
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:17,770
pieces together that will one day become cinema.

42
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:22,209
By 1897, the German optician-turned-film pioneer
Oskar Messter perfected his

43
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:25,849
design for the stop-and-go mechanism, called
the Maltese Cross – named after the medal

44
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:26,849
with the same shape.

45
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:30,189
It’s also called the Geneva Drive, because
it was first invented in Geneva, Switzerland

46
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:31,870
for use in mechanical watches.

47
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,319
Messter’s device has really stood the test
of time: we still use a version of it in most

48
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,319
projectors today.

49
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,109
But, back to the Lumières and their motion
picture camera. Transition PUNCH!

50
00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:42,220
Their whole contraption was a compact, portable
box.

51
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,129
It was light enough for one person to carry.

52
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:47,409
The camera was operated by a hand crank, so
it didn’t rely on an electric power source.

53
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:51,510
It used the same 35 millimeter film as Edison’s
kinetograph, but it could also develop the

54
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,400
film that it shot – no more sending film
off to a lab and waiting for the mail.

55
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,940
...I hate waiting for the mail.

56
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,059
But, that's not all, once the film
had been developed, the Lumière device could

57
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,240
be reconfigured into a projection machine.

58
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,500
So many things in one. It's so... aw it's just good.

59
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,660
They could run the developed film back through
the intermittent stop-and-go mechanism, and,

60
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:10,900
with a bright light source, the images would
project onto a wall or a screen.

61
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,900
This device could do it all.

62
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,419
You could carry it with you out into the world,
capture footage, develop the film, and then

63
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,400
project it, any time, anywhere, any way you
wanted.

64
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,340
Don't do it vertical though... commentors hate that.

65
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,360
Compared to the kinetograph and kinetoscope,
it was kind of like the technological leap

66
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:26,279
from an old school flip phone to a smartphone.

67
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,260
The Lumière Brothers wanted to call their
invention the “cinématographe,” which means

68
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,240
“writing with movement.”

69
00:03:31,249 --> 00:03:34,700
Like Edison, the Lumière Brothers were savvy
businessmen, and secured international patents

70
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,890
on all their technology.

71
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:40,169
Doing Edison one better, they saw a lot of
potential in having large, public film screenings.

72
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:43,620
Before the public unveiling of their cinématographe,
they held a series of private parties where

73
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,540
they projected films for groups of distinguished
guests, stoking interest and excitement.

74
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:52,520
And then in Paris, on December 28th, 1895,
at the Salon Indien in the basement of the

75
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,389
Grand Café, Auguste and Louis Lumière screened
a series of ten short films and changed the

76
00:03:57,389 --> 00:03:58,389
world forever.

77
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:01,859
Now, I should mention that this wasn’t technically
the first public screening of a motion picture.

78
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:05,369
That honor, as far as we know, goes to Woodville
Latham, an American chemist and kinetoscope

79
00:04:05,369 --> 00:04:09,260
owner, who projected a film of a boxing match
in New York in May, 1895.

80
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,779
What set the Lumière Brothers apart was that
they played up the intrigue of their device

81
00:04:12,779 --> 00:04:16,639
and gained publicity, plus their superior
image quality and the sheer number of films

82
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,639
they presented.

83
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,180
This is the movie business, after all, and
hype almost always wins.

84
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:24,120
So the credit for first successful public
screening typically goes to Auguste and Louis Lumière.

85
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,380
Sorry, Latham. Better luck next time. Maybe go back to chemistry.

86
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,940
Among the films the Lumière Brothers screened
that night was “The Train Arrives at La Ciotat Station.”

87
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,420
In the film, a train – you guessed it – arrives
at a station. Kinda spoiled it with the title.

88
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,900
In a single, uninterrupted shot, it comes
toward the camera, stops, and the passengers disembark.

89
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,180
Legend has it that when the first audience
saw this movie projected on the wall, it was

90
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,420
so unfamiliar and realistic that they ran
screaming from the theater, fearing for their lives.

91
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,020
In recent years, historians have thrown cold
water on this story for a couple reasons.

92
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:56,250
First, seeing images projected onto walls
wouldn’t have been a new experience for

93
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,250
a lot of Parisians.

94
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,930
Some version of the magic lantern projection
device had been used for education and entertainment

95
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:04,729
since the 17th century, employing a light
source and a lens to project images or paintings

96
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:06,330
from glass plates up onto a wall.

97
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:10,260
Not to mention, most of the Lumière audience
would probably have been aware of kinetoscope films.

98
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,520
So chances are no one actually thought a
train was about to drive through the wall

99
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,520
and run them all down.

100
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,759
More likely, the audience might have shrieked
in delight at the size and clarity of the

101
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,340
images projected, and at the sheer magic of
seeing these pictures come to life.

102
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,969
Remember, film presents us with the illusion
of reality.

103
00:05:23,969 --> 00:05:27,570
And like any good magic trick or optical illusion,
part of the thrill is knowing that what you’re

104
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,440
seeing isn’t real, but not being able to
tell how the magician pulled it off.

105
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,030
The story of the screaming audience in the
Grand Café also reveals the power film has

106
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,699
to create a communal experience.

107
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:39,599
While the technical wizardry of their cinématographe
was groundbreaking, the unique group psychology

108
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:42,650
of movie-going may have been the Lumières’
greatest contribution to film history.

109
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:46,219
When you’re in an audience watching a film,
you’re having a specific, personal experience,

110
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,720
but you’re also part of a pop-up community.

111
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,920
... and sometimes that community has a has a bunch of kids who won't be quiet and you're trying to watch Batman vs. Superman!

112
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,611
Think back to the last hysterical comedy you

113
00:05:54,611 --> 00:05:57,710
saw in a movie theater, and then tried to
watch again by yourself at home.

114
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,199
It’s not the same, is it?

115
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,930
Film is this unique artistic medium that can
take on different meanings depending when,

116
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,669
where, and with whom you’re watching it.

117
00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:07,479
Now, the Lumière Brothers’ films all shared
a few characteristics.

118
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:11,600
They were silent, black-and-white, and uninterrupted
shots that lasted less than a minute – much

119
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,550
like the films out of Edison’s Black Maria.

120
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:17,879
But rather than capturing stage performers
and skits, the Lumière films were mini-documentaries,

121
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:18,879
known as “actualités.”

122
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,949
They focused on slices of everyday life: two
babies fighting over lunch, a group of workers

123
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:26,780
leaving a factory at the end of the day, and,
of course, trains arriving at stations.

124
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,110
These films were financially successful right
out of the gate.

125
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:33,319
The Lumière Brothers’ first screening brought
in 35 francs, at 1 franc per person.

126
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,260
And within a month, they were making 7,000
francs per week.

127
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,480
that's... *counting* 7,000 people!

128
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,520
Meanwhile, other inventors were making cinématographe-like devices with cool names like the Bioskop

129
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,780
and the Theatrograph.

130
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,850
Some were directly inspired by the Lumière
Brothers, while others were independent.

131
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:51,159
Thomas Edison saw the financial success the
Lumière Brothers were having and wanted a

132
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:55,720
very big piece of that action – abandoning
the kinetoscope to jump into theatrical projection.

133
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,560
Edison and other inventors also began experimenting
with longer films. BORING!

134
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,580
But there was a big problem: these longer
film strips kept tearing inside the projector.

135
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,669
Enter Woodville Latham.

136
00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:05,669
Remember him?

137
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:07,639
The guy who really held the first public
projection of a movie?

138
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:11,129
He held the patent for the Latham Loop, a
different way to feed film into a projector,

139
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:15,050
which involved a pair of small, loose loops
of film – one above and one below the projector’s

140
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,199
lens – held in place with extra sprockets.

141
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,599
This helped protect the film from vibrations
and tension, which could lead to damage.

142
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:25,620
In 1895, another pair of early film pioneers,
C. Francis Jenkins and Thomas Armat, used

143
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,849
the Latham Loop in a projector of their own
design and called it the Vitascope.

144
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:32,689
Edison saw this device, bought it outright,
and released it as the “Edison Vitascope,”

145
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:36,449
giving the original inventors almost no credit…
‘cause that’s how Thomas Edison rolled.

146
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:39,750
Throughout all this experimentation, most
people thought of films as a fad that would

147
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:44,240
burn brightly for a few years, and then disappear
– like arsenic as medicine, séances, or

148
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,360
Victorian “tear catchers.”

149
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,860
Even the Lumière Brothers got out of the
movie business in 1905, because they didn’t

150
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,059
see a future for film. Good idea!

151
00:07:51,059 --> 00:07:55,630
And it’s true, 50-second Vaudeville performances
and actualités will only entertain audiences

152
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,630
for so long.

153
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:59,610
But film was growing into something bigger
– a method of mass communication that was

154
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,639
starting to make itself indispensable.

155
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:05,870
As time went on, filmmakers would take cinématographes
to far-flung places, capturing movies of the

156
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:09,180
Amazon Basin, the pyramids at Giza, and the
ruins of Ancient Rome.

157
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,599
Suddenly, you could walk into a theater in
Peoria, Illinois and see Sherpas climbing

158
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,520
the Himalayas. ... Without drugs!

159
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,020
In some ways, these kinds of films knit the
world closer together, showing people sights

160
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:19,469
they’d never experience in real life.

161
00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:21,900
You can even compare film history to the early
days of YouTube.

162
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:26,460
Sure, we started with Jawed at the zoo, and
cat videos, and kids on dental anesthesia.

163
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,860
But that was just scratching the surface of
a medium that has let us create so many weird,

164
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,100
wonderful, and important things, and has changed
the way we see ourselves and the world around us.

165
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,760
Today, we introduced you to the Lumière Brothers
and their cinématographe, the all-in-one

166
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,830
camera, film developing lab, and projector.

167
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,779
We learned about the first big public film
screenings, and how people were beginning

168
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:46,600
to have collective movie-going experiences,
as well as very personal ones.

169
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,580
We discussed actualités, the snapshots of
everyday life, and how some filmmakers were

170
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,860
beginning to push the envelope, exploring
the world and making longer movies.

171
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,399
And next time, we’ll talk about the very
first films to tell stories, using editing

172
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:00,500
and special effects to manipulate reality
in exciting new ways.

173
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,050
Crash Course Film History is produced in association
with PBS Digital Studios.

174
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:08,060
You can head over to their channel to check
out a playlist of their latest amazing shows,

175
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,490
like PBS Infinite Series, The Art Assignment,
and Brain Craft.

176
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:15,190
This episode of Crash Course was filmed in
the Doctor Cheryl C. Kinney Crash Course Studio

177
00:09:15,190 --> 00:00:00,000
with the help of these nice actualites and our
amazing graphics team, is Thought Cafe.
