1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:08,039
Some movies are huge spectacles, with stunning
special effects and mythic characters who

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,790
hold the fate of the universe in their hands.

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,559
On the other end of the spectrum are more
intimate films,

4
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,049
with complex characters navigating their everyday
lives.

5
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:20,340
But just because the scale is smaller, it
doesn’t mean they’re any less powerful.

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,320
Today we’re going to talk about one of those
movies, whose fresh subject matter, unique

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,080
structure, and well-crafted filmmaking made
it one of the most celebrated movies of 2016.

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,340
It’s time to dive into Moonlight.

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:44,420
[Intro Music]

10
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,860
Moonlight was loosely adapted from an unproduced

11
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,530
play by Tarell Alvin McCraney called In Moonlight
Black Boys Look Blue.

12
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,940
And it marks the second feature film from
co-writer-director Barry Jenkins.

13
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,970
His first feature was the 2009 romantic drama
Medicine for Melancholy.

14
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:03,670
That film stars Wyatt Cenac and Tracey Heggins
as a pair of 20-something black Americans

15
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,120
after a one-night stand.

16
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,390
It’s a rumination on identity, race, and
intimacy.

17
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:12,410
For his second film, Jenkins chose to tell
a story that tackles similar themes, but with

18
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,710
a harder edge and more emotionally torn-up
characters.

19
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,960
Centered around three pivotal moments in the
life of a young black American gay man, Moonlight

20
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,960
is as much about performed masculinity as
it is about growing up gay.

21
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,341
And in both cases, it sets out to challenge
commonly held stereotypes of black men.

22
00:01:28,341 --> 00:01:33,060
The film follows its protagonist Chiron from
boyhood through young adulthood in the dilapidated

23
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,100
housing projects of Liberty City in Miami.

24
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,920
The first part follows Chiron as an extremely
withdrawn young boy, played with expressive

25
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,909
silence by Alex Hibbert.

26
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,700
He comes into the orbit of a local drug dealer
named Juan, who briefly becomes a sort of

27
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,700
father figure.

28
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,180
The second section of the film picks up the
story in high school.

29
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:54,030
Chiron, now played by Ashton Sanders, has
become a lanky teenager, and is only moderately

30
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,520
less shy than before.

31
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,380
His bullies have grown up too, and now seem
much more threatening.

32
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,340
And in the third and final section of the
film we find Chiron in his mid-twenties, a

33
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,299
hulking mass of muscle.

34
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:08,369
Played by Trevante Rhodes, the grown-up Chiron
has seemingly hardened, spent time behind

35
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:10,788
bars, and now works as a drug dealer in Atlanta.

36
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:14,650
The filmmaking in Moonlight is extremely subjective
to Chiron’s experience.

37
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,140
Jenkins doesn’t just tell his story, he
makes us feel it.

38
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,870
Film is an incredibly effective medium for
exploring a character’s perspective, using

39
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,810
the same tools that create the illusion of
reality.

40
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,590
This happens more directly when a film cuts
from a character’s face to a shot of what

41
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,590
they’re seeing.

42
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,350
But it can be more subtle as well, using cuts
to flashes of a memory as it intrudes on the

43
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,870
present, or camera movements to emphasize
a character’s internal feelings.

44
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,080
In Moonlight, Jenkins harnesses everything
from the shots and the mise-en-scene to the

45
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,940
editing and the sound to give us access to
his otherwise opaque main characters.

46
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,160
Chiron needs protection and guidance, and
Juan, played with grace and moral heft by

47
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:51,640
Oscar-winner Mahershala Ali, steps into that
void.

48
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,640
He really sees Chiron, without pity and
without judgement, and teaches him how to

49
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,840
navigate everything from his own identity
to the bullies that terrorize him after school.

50
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,460
In particular, there’s a moment when Juan
takes Chiron to the beach and beckons him

51
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,550
to come into the water.

52
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:09,360
The camera stays with Chiron, holding on him,
pushing in as he decides what to do.

53
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,840
In that hesitation, and that subtle camera
move, we understand the competing desires

54
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,700
in Chiron’s head — he wants to join Juan,
but is desperate not to make himself vulnerable.

55
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,270
Once he’s in the water and Juan is teaching
him how to swim, the filmmaking turns subjective

56
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:27,599
again, jump-cutting between shots as Chiron
gets the hang of it and even begins to enjoy

57
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,599
himself.

58
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:32,270
It’s almost as if he’s been freed from
the long takes, along with his hesitance.

59
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:36,260
Jenkins is also underlining the fact that
Juan isn’t just teaching Chiron to swim,

60
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:40,480
he’s showing him how to take charge of himself,
how to keep himself afloat.

61
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,900
Juan is giving him the confidence to trust,
to accept help, and to make human connections.

62
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,120
There are ways to shoot the scene where it’s
simply a man teaching a boy to swim.

63
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,940
But through subjective camerawork and editing,
the filmmakers also show us what it means

64
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,000
to the characters.

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,709
In addition, the scene challenges several
stereotypes of black American men.

66
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:02,830
First, Juan’s compassion is the opposite
of the harsh, violent depiction drug dealers

67
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,800
often get in mainstream films.

68
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,730
And second, black Americans have historically
been systematically and disproportionately

69
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,730
not given opportunities to learn how to swim.

70
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:15,940
As is so often the case in Moonlight, the
filmmakers are taking on more than one stereotype

71
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,940
at a time.

72
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,478
Now, a film’s style can often be broken
down into two rough categories: realism and

73
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:22,479
formalism.

74
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,449
Realism refers to a style in which cinematic
techniques like shots, cuts, mise-en-scene,

75
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:29,309
and sound are meant to be as unobtrusive as
possible.

76
00:04:29,309 --> 00:04:33,620
The whole idea is that the filmmaking tools
go largely unnoticed by the audience, allowing

77
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,729
the story and characters to take center stage.

78
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:40,080
Formalism, on the other hand, is a style in
which those techniques clearly and deliberately

79
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,439
alter our perception of the film’s reality.

80
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:46,349
Things like slow motion or reverse photography,
obvious manipulation of the film’s sound

81
00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:50,710
or color scape, discontinuity editing, and
using jump cuts or repeated shots.

82
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,129
These techniques all draw attention to themselves.

83
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:57,409
In formalist films, the form takes precedence
over the content.

84
00:04:57,409 --> 00:05:01,940
Think about the wild, operatic camerawork
and editing of Martin Scorsese’s Raging Bull.

85
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,600
Or the curated, almost caricatured worlds
created by Wes Anderson in films like Moonrise

86
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,629
Kingdom
or The Grand Budapest Hotel.

87
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:12,849
While some films lean heavily into one style
or the other, most mainstream movies contain

88
00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:14,280
elements of both.

89
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,710
And Moonlight is no exception.

90
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,259
Jenkins captures much of Chiron’s experience
with realist techniques.

91
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:22,770
Handheld shots follow Chiron as a young boy
as he runs away from his tormentors.

92
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,119
Natural lighting fills the scene when Juan
finds him sitting outside his house.

93
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:30,439
The movie cuts traditionally back and forth
between a teenage Chiron and his mother Paula,

94
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:34,689
fiercely portrayed by Naomi Harris, as she
demands money during her tragic downward spiral

95
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:35,840
into drug addiction.

96
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,009
In these moments, Jenkins tries to keep the
filmmaking out of the way, to give us a sense

97
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:43,259
of being there in the room with the action
and watching it unfold.

98
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:47,469
But then – especially at pivotal emotional
moments – the film moves into a much more

99
00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:49,520
aggressively formalist style.

100
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,050
As a teenager, at least one other kid seems
to get Chiron and has known him for years.

101
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,949
Kevin, played by Jharrel Jerome, presents
himself as confident and gregarious.

102
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:02,169
He’s as at home in his own body and persona
as Chiron is awkward in his.

103
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:06,469
Chiron and Kevin share an intimate moment
one night on the same beach where, years earlier,

104
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:08,330
Juan had taught Chiron how to swim.

105
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,189
Chiron opens up to Kevin for the first time,
and the scene turns intimate.

106
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:14,099
They kiss, and then Kevin takes things a step
further.

107
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:17,669
During this romantic encounter, the shots
become almost impressionistic.

108
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:22,360
The camera captures their profiles and silhouettes,
leaned in close, Chiron’s head on Kevin’s

109
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,360
shoulder.

110
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,719
Chiron’s hand grips the sand, and Nicholas
Britell’s wondrous score takes over.

111
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:30,889
Again, the movie is challenging how cinema
usually presents black American men, usually

112
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:33,620
macho or brutal — but not vulnerable.

113
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:38,400
Here, Chiron and Kevin open up to one another,
sharing fears and hopes, and then engage in

114
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,300
a tender, sexual relationship.

115
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,180
Back at school, one of the bullies taunts
Kevin into beating up Chiron to prove his

116
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,569
own masculinity.

117
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:49,520
Afterwards, Chiron sits in an office, listening
to the principal lecture him.

118
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,909
He cries, breaking for the first time, then
tunes her out.

119
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:57,210
The sound of her voice literally drops out
of the scene, and the camera moves low to

120
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,150
catch Chiron’s hardening glare as the sound
design ramps up in intensity.

121
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:29,469
In moments like these, Jenkins breaks the
realist tendency of his film, masterfully

122
00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:31,780
drawing us into his character’s heart and
mind.

123
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:35,779
It’s an especially smart decision given
how interior the film is.

124
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:39,439
Jenkins uses many of the tricks of cinema
to help us understand Chiron’s constant

125
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:43,150
struggle to reconcile his identity with the
world around him.

126
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:47,710
And it’s his struggle to be himself, a gay
black man in America, that drives the emotional

127
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,319
narrative of the film.

128
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,240
Cinema scholar J. Ken Stuckey argues that,
“masculinity in its various forms is the

129
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,509
main antagonist of this film.

130
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:59,259
One of the most difficult aspects of being
gay is the way in which one’s sexuality

131
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:02,819
can telegraph itself against one’s will,
even before puberty.”

132
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:07,429
We see Chiron strive to fit in with other
boys his age, all playing a makeshift soccer

133
00:08:07,429 --> 00:08:08,729
game in the movie’s first part.

134
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:12,360
The camera gives us Chiron’s point of view
as the boys stare at him – and therefore

135
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,360
us!

136
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,969
We feel the weight of their eyes.

137
00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:17,300
It’s off-putting, menacing even.

138
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:22,800
In fact, among those boys it’s only Kevin
who truly sees Chiron as a person, rather

139
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,179
than some kind of “other” to be made fun
of.

140
00:08:25,179 --> 00:08:29,259
And when Kevin and Chiron wrestle on the ground,
Jenkins revels in their connection.

141
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:32,600
The film takes its time with this moment,
giving us dislocated shots of their hands

142
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,779
and legs, bodies grappling with one another.

143
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:37,549
They seem somehow both trapped and free.

144
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:41,879
It’s a powerful visual metaphor for Chiron’s
central struggle — pushing and pulling against

145
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,580
the expectations of his community and the
stereotypes attached to his gender and sexual

146
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,580
identity.

147
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,970
And it sets up what’s to come.

148
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:52,210
As an adult, in the third part of the film,
Chiron’s taken on so many signifiers of

149
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:55,340
traditional masculinity, he’s almost unrecognizable.

150
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:59,560
In addition to his muscles, he wears gold
grills over his teeth, carries a gun, and

151
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,670
banters easily with one of his drug-dealing
underlings.

152
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:05,920
He even has a miniature crown on his dashboard,
just like Juan had in the opening.

153
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,901
Chiron visits Paula in rehab, where she begs
his forgiveness, blaming herself for the way

154
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,160
his life has turned out.

155
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,200
Paula: But your heart ain't gotta be black like mine, baby.

156
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,440
Paula: I love you, Chiron.

157
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,200
Paula: I do.

158
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,920
Then, after an out-of-the-blue phone call,
Chiron drives down to Miami to surprise Kevin

159
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,160
at the restaurant where he works.

160
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,460
The two haven’t seen each other since their
altercation back in high school.

161
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:41,120
Their conversation shifts in tone from awkward
to inquisitive to intimate and back again,

162
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,490
as they catch up on the past decade.

163
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:46,500
But more importantly, they’re re-negotiating
the terms of their relationship.

164
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,880
Bit by bit, Chiron’s masculine posturing
falls away.

165
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,900
He’s the same complex, vulnerable character
we’ve come to know throughout the film.

166
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:58,750
And, once again, he breaks away from the stereotypical
black male that’s portrayed in lot of media.

167
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:02,470
In the end, the two return to Kevin’s house,
where Chiron shares that he hasn’t been

168
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,720
touched by a man since that night on the beach
with Kevin.

169
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,320
Chiron: You're the only man that's ever touched me.

170
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,030
The film ends with an intimate scene — Chiron
cradled in Kevin’s arms — and a brief

171
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:33,270
shot of Chiron as a boy standing on the infamous
beach, looking back at us.

172
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,760
And at himself.

173
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,360
So there’s no denying that Barry Jenkins’
Moonlight is as thoughtful as it is elegant

174
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,360
and compassionate.

175
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,260
You might appreciate it as an exquisite coming-of-age
story told in a unique way.

176
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:48,320
Or as an exercise in how formalist cinematic
techniques can root us in a character’s

177
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,320
point of view.

178
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,270
The film takes on all sorts of stereotypes
and assumptions about black American masculinity,

179
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:56,680
as well as complex themes of sexuality and
self-acceptance.

180
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:02,290
And it does it all with a skill and immediacy
most films ten times its size never get near.

181
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,970
Sometimes it’s the little movies that pack
the biggest punch.

182
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:09,370
Next time, we’ll travel to the heart of
Africa for the tale of a child soldier struggling

183
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:13,940
with his own larger-than-life father figure
in Cary Fukunaga’s Beasts of No Nation.

184
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,720
Crash Course Film Criticism is produced in
association with PBS Digital Studios.
