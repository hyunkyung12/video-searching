00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:03,460
Hey there, I’m Mike Rugnetta and this is
Crashcourse Mythology.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:09,019
Today we’re going to try to do justice to
the Norse pantheon--a very scary wolf, an

3
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:16,090
amazing tree, a rainbow bridge, some frost
giants, and way more than what I learned from
reading Thor comics.

4
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,140
No, not you, Thoth.
Your th is a plosive.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,920
We’re talking voiceless dental fricative here.
THOR.

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,980
You know, this joke might work better in print.

7
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:34,760
[Theme Music]

8
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,260
We met some of the Norse gods when we looked
at one of their creation stories.

9
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,540
The source for that myth, and many other stories
from Norse mythology, is the Prose Edda, an

10
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:51,760
Icelandic compendium written by the amazingly-named
Snorri Sturluson around 1220 CE.

11
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,230
This means that one of our main sources for
the tales of Germanic and Scandinavian gods

12
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:00,280
and goddesses comes from the far edge of their
world.

13
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,910
It’s also important because the Prose Edda
is relatively NEW.

14
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:08,320
So one rainbow bridge we’re going to have
to cross here is the way that later Christian

15
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,850
ideas influence the existing version of these
myths.

16
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,330
Partly because of Snorri, there’s a tendency
to think of Norse mythology as belonging to

17
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,750
Scandinavia, but that’s not quite right.

18
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:24,170
The Norse Pantheon has roots in the religion
and mythology of Germanic people who migrated

19
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,170
into Europe.

20
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,840
The Romans, especially our pal Tacitus, recorded
what they understood of the Germanic tribes’

21
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,620
beliefs, but they translated Germanic gods
into their own terms.

22
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:39,530
So Wotan, or Wodan, who we’re calling Odin,
became associated with Mercury.

23
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:45,070
Tyr, or Tiwaz, a warrior god, became associated
with the Roman god of war, Mars.

24
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,370
And Thor was Jupiter or Jove.

25
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:53,070
In their own terms, there are two sets of
Norse deities: first, the Vanir, associated

26
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,920
with the earth and fertility.

27
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,920
They’re the older set of gods.

28
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,240
And second, the Aesir, associated with the
sky.

29
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,440
The Vanir were led by Freyr and Freya, brother
and sister and also king and queen.

30
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,479
They were the children of Njord.

31
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,878
Who also has a terrific name.

32
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:15,879
According to Sturluson: “Freyr is an exceedingly
famous god; he decides when the sun shall

33
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:20,849
shine and when the rain come down, and along
with that the fruitfulness of the earth,

34
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:24,049
and he is good to invoke for peace and plenty.

35
00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:27,379
He also brings about the prosperity of men.”

36
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:32,129
So he is definitely the god you want to honor
if you’re having a picnic.

37
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:35,529
(Well, him and Amateratsu, Japanese sun goddess.

38
00:02:35,529 --> 00:02:39,459
And while we’re at it, why not also Aphrodite,
because EVERYONE HAS A THING FOR.. ok you

39
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,499
get it)
The Vanir and the Aesir warred, but eventually

40
00:02:42,499 --> 00:02:48,879
reconciled and the Vanir came to live in Asgard,
one of the nine mythical Norse worlds.

41
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,109
Although they also have their own realm, Vanaheim.

42
00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:57,030
Not to be confused with Anaheim, the realm
of Walt Disney, Oranges, and Online Video

43
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,030
conferences.

44
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:02,769
If you want the Euhumerist opinion, or, where
we take mythology as an explanation of historical

45
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:08,659
fact, this war may reflect a time where there
were two competing religions among the tribal

46
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:11,900
people of the north, which eventually teamed
up.

47
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,159
Vanir and Aesir, stronger together!

48
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,159
Like Voltron!

49
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,319
But GODS.

50
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,379
Another Norse god is Heimdall, also called
the White God.

51
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:25,499
He’s associated with the sea because nine
waves birthed him... must have been a chaotic

52
00:03:25,499 --> 00:03:27,029
day in the maternity ward.

53
00:03:27,029 --> 00:03:31,909
Heimdall was the sentry of the gods and the
archenemy of Loki, who you might know from

54
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:33,349
his role as Tom Hiddleston.

55
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:38,120
According to Sturluson, “[Heimdall] needs
less sleep than a bird and can see a hundred

56
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,409
leagues in front of him as well by night as
by day.

57
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:47,449
He can hear the grass growing on the earth
and the wool on the sheep and everything that

58
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:48,620
makes noise.”

59
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,159
Boy, poor Heimdall.

60
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:55,340
Imagine going to a dinner party and listening
to everyone chew.

61
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,449
Some traditions place Heimdall in the Aesir,
some in the Vanir.

62
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:03,689
The Vanir are also associated with a golden
boar said to travel above and below the earth

63
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:05,109
like the sun.

64
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:09,659
Gullinbursti, as it was called, appeared on
warriors’ crests and helmets, especially

65
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:11,059
in Uppsala.

66
00:04:11,059 --> 00:04:15,639
Just like in Greece and Egypt, different gods
in the Norse pantheon were worshipped in different

67
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,639
regions.

68
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,579
Thor is probably the most famous of the Aesir.

69
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:23,349
Probably the second most famous is Odin, Thor’s
dad.

70
00:04:23,349 --> 00:04:28,620
Odin is the father god, who was associated
with war, especially with the raw, almost

71
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,360
ecstatic warrior rage of berserkers.

72
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,890
He was also a wizard who swayed battles through
magic.

73
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:42,129
Imagine, like, Gandalf, but with one eye,
lots of muscles, an unhealthy desire for arcane

74
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:43,540
wisdom and a bit of a mean streak.

75
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:49,919
Odin inherited his warrior-god nature from
his Germanic predecessors, Wodan and Tiwaz.

76
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,169
As Kevin Crossley-Holland remarked: “A culture
finds the gods it needs and the Norse world

77
00:04:55,169 --> 00:05:00,280
needed a god to justify the violence that
[was] one of its hallmarks.”

78
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,099
Basically, if you’re a warlike society,
a war god is pretty convenient.

79
00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:10,930
Odin inspired victory and foresaw defeat with
his shamanistic precognition . He was also

80
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:15,939
the god of poetry who travelled to the land
of the Giants, Jotunheim, to drink the mead

81
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:20,060
of poetry and bring it back to the Aesir and
Vanir.

82
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,030
MMMM… poetry mead.

83
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,720
Another part of Odin’s story is his sacrifice
and re-birth as a wiser god.

84
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,180
According to one version he hung himself from
the world tree so he could drink the mead

85
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,180
of wisdom.

86
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,960
Guess Odin couldn’t stop at just one mead,
huh?

87
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,960
This was when he sacrificed his eye, too.

88
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,419
Odin was married to Frigg, a goddess who could
also see the future.

89
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:48,020
Odin’s children were Thor, whose mother
was the Earth itself, Baldr, the most beautiful

90
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:53,740
of the gods who was killed by Hodr his blind
brother, and Tyr, although one source has

91
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,229
Tyr’s father as the giant Hymir.

92
00:05:56,229 --> 00:05:59,449
In some stories Baldr is a human warrior favored
by Odin.

93
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:04,879
Baldr is “the wisest of the gods, and the
sweetest-spoken, and the most merciful, but

94
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:10,039
it is a characteristic of his that once he
has pronounced a judgment it can never be

95
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:11,039
altered.”

96
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,780
Odin has another son, Hermod the bold, who
was sent to retrieve Baldr from a city in

97
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:20,730
the underworld, Nifelheim, ruled by the goddess
Hel, yup, that’s Hel with a single hockey

98
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:21,730
stick.

99
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:26,020
And she was said to be a daughter of Loki,
who also helped kill Baldr.

100
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,750
Loki is confusing.

101
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:32,699
It’s never clear whether he’s a god or
a giant, or even whether he’s good or evil.

102
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:36,870
He has been called the son of two giants,
but also the foster-brother of Odin.

103
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:40,909
He’s a trickster, so maybe his uncertain
pedigree makes some sense?

104
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:45,069
He’s also a thief, but also also sometimes
helps the Aesir.

105
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:50,669
He’s the father of several monsters including
the World Serpent, Jormungand, the wolf, Fenrir,

106
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:51,669
and Hel.

107
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:54,040
Not to put too fine a point on it, but Loki
is.

108
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,040
the.

109
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,040
worst.

110
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,270
as we’ll see in our episode on … Ragnarok!

111
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,409
The mythical event.

112
00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:01,580
Not the comic book event.

113
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,580
Not the movie event.

114
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,090
Not even the Gwar record.

115
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,069
Just the literal end of the world.

116
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:09,169
Tyr is identified with war and justice.

117
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:13,430
In some traditions, he’s also a son of Odin,
but as you’ve probably noticed, it’s not

118
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,389
exactly easy to pin down parentage in the
Norse world.

119
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:17,389
Blame those nine waves.

120
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:22,550
Tyr’s position as a god of both war and
justice is interesting, given what we learned

121
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,889
about Vikings in Crashcourse World History.

122
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:29,800
While known for their fearsome raiding, Vikings
also had a strict legal code with certain

123
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,360
elements of democratic governance.

124
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,069
And they were really into skiing.

125
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:37,740
There are other gods in the Norse pantheon,
but they don’t really feature much.

126
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:42,830
Bragi, a son of Odin, was another god of poetry,
while Ull was concerned mainly with archery

127
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,219
and hitting the slopes, brah.

128
00:07:44,219 --> 00:07:45,219
Yup.

129
00:07:45,219 --> 00:07:46,219
There’s a god of skiing.

130
00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:48,750
There’s Vali, Odin’s son who avenged Baldr’s
death.

131
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:53,520
And Vidar, son of Odin and the giantess Grid,
avenged Odin’s death.

132
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,710
I need an infographic.

133
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,159
Oh, great.

134
00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:01,139
The Norse goddesses are relatively minor figures
in the myths.

135
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,289
Freya is the only one who seems to have personality.

136
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:05,219
She’s a goddess of love.

137
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:09,229
Faithfulness to her husband, Freyr, is not
her strong suit.

138
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:12,469
Her strong suit is definitely her amazing
feather jacket.

139
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:16,389
She also has A CAT DRAWN CHARIOT.

140
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:17,389
That is not a joke.

141
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:21,949
And like Freya, goddess Geifon is one of the
Vanir and she is associated with ploughing

142
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:22,949
and fertility.

143
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:26,500
Eir is a goddess of healing, Sjofn and Lofn
are also goddesses of love.

144
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,870
Var punishes those who betray their marriage
oaths and nothing can be hidden from her.

145
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,929
Syn, with a Y, is a goddess associated with
justice.

146
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:39,729
And who couldn’t love a goddess named Snotra,
who is associated with wisdom and self-discipline.

147
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:40,840
And also head colds.

148
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,289
THANKS I’LL BE HERE ALL WEEK!

149
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:47,350
Snortra stands in contrast with Saga, goddess
of poetry, whose main role seems to be Odin’s

150
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,350
drinking companion.

151
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,350
Skål!

152
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:54,170
Frigg is Odin’s wife and the mother of multiple
gods, but we don’t know much about her.

153
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:58,900
She is a maternal goddess who mourns the loss
of her son Baldr, and was invoked by women

154
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,010
in labor.

155
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,730
Like Odin, she seemed to be able to know the
future.

156
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:03,730
Now!

157
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:04,730
On to a myth.

158
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,820
I’m going to be honest: Norse myths are
like the frat party of mythology.

159
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,790
There’s a lot of fighting and drinking and
laughing, though no beer pong.

160
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,120
First, some quick backstory.

161
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,690
Odin championed warriors, picking his favorites
and sending Valkyries to bring them to Valhalla,

162
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:22,160
which seems like a nifty way to travel.

163
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,520
Thor was the god of farmers, and there were
a lot of farmers in Scandinavia.

164
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,410
But he was also a mighty warrior, huge with
a giant red beard.

165
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:36,540
Not so bright, but who needs smarts when you’re
the god of thunder and lightning?

166
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:41,880
He protected the Aesir and Vanir from the
giants, and in a stunning bit of surely coincidental

167
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,880
wordplay...

168
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,050
Mjollnir, his famous hammer was also a symbol
... of fertility.

169
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,810
Let’s go to the Thoughtbubble.

170
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,900
One day Thor woke up and couldn’t find his
hammer.

171
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,450
He sent Loki to locate it.

172
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:58,740
Loki borrowed Freya’s sweet falcon jacket,
turned it into an actual falcon and went searching.

173
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,190
He found his way to the hall of the giant
Thrym, who said that he had stolen Thor’s

174
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:07,360
hammer and he wouldn’t give it back unless
Freya agreed to marry him.

175
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,590
Freya said, over my dead body.

176
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:14,960
So, Heimdall, the sentry god, came up with
a brilliant idea: Put Thor in a wedding dress

177
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,470
and have him pretend to be Freya!

178
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:22,770
The other gods laughed and Thor sulked, but
Loki prevailed on him because without his

179
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,310
hammer, the gods were vulnerable to giants.

180
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:29,430
So they found a giant wedding dress and a
thick veil and headed off to Jotunheim.

181
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:34,600
Once there, Thrym threw his new bride and
her bridesmaid, Loki, a wedding feast.

182
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:40,270
Thor ate an entire ox, eight salmon, all the
sweets and three horns of mead.

183
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:45,670
When Thrym commented that he’d never seen
a woman eat so much, Loki explained that “Freya”

184
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:49,350
was so excited to be married that she hadn’t
eaten for eight days.

185
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:54,880
Thrym seemed satisfied, but then he peeked
under her veil and saw his bride’s glowing

186
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,200
red eyes.

187
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,410
Loki again reassured Thrym that his bride
was so excited that she hadn’t slept for

188
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,530
seven days.

189
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:07,170
Finally, Thrym offered up Mjollnir as a wedding-symbol,
saying: “Put Mjollnir between her knees

190
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:10,700
so that Var will hear our marriage oath and
give her blessing.”

191
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,890
As soon as the hammer was placed between his
knees, Thor snatched it up, ripped off his

192
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:16,940
veil and did what he does best: clobber giants.

193
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,620
He crushed Thyrm’s skull and killed every
other giant at the wedding feast, including

194
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,620
the women.

195
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:27,970
The tale ends: “And so Thor, son of Odin,
won back his hammer.”

196
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,550
Thanks Thoughtbubble, that was awesome.

197
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,550
And disturbing.

198
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,440
And of course, soaked in mead and blood.

199
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,860
Norse gods, like Greek ones, are all too human,
and seem to misbehave accordingly.

200
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:44,100
But unlike other mythic traditions, the Norse
sagas seem to lean less heavily on metaphor--they’re

201
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,750
rollicking adventure tales, perfect for Vikings,
lusty warriors who like nothing more than

202
00:11:48,750 --> 00:12:10,020
a roasted ox, a few horns of ale, and a good
punch-up.

203
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:34,490
And skiing.

204
00:12:34,490 --> 00:00:00,000
Thanks for watching, see you next time.
