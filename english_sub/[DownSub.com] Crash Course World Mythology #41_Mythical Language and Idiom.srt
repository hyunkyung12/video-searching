1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:05,040
Hey there, I’m Mike Rugnetta, this is Crash
Course Mythology and today ... we behold our

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,040
own apocalypse.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,170
Yes, it’s the end of our time together,
on this here earthly plane.

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,710
Our journey together has surely been epic.

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:18,130
And we could go on for months with more exciting
and uncomfortable stories of floods and incest,

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:22,860
but alas - Thoth and I must retire to the
spiritual realm atop Mount Crashcourse.

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,300
Throughout this series, we’ve examined myths
from around the world and across the centuries.

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,920
We’ve met vomiting gods and responding dragons.

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,640
We met Loki, who was the worst, and Freya!

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,269
Who in my mind, is the best.

11
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:36,370
Cat chariot!

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,370
Battle swine!

13
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,370
What a lady...

14
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,319
Anyway... what ties all the stories we discussed
together is that they’re powerful.

15
00:00:41,319 --> 00:00:46,039
They’re meaningful enough to be preserved
and passed down through generations.

16
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:48,980
And so, they can help us understand the world.

17
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:54,280
They provide insight into how previous civilizations
made sense of their circumstances.

18
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,179
Myths can hint at some of the deep structures
of our collective psyches and can even offer

19
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:01,920
a glimpse into our own minds.

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,990
And they’re the best place to go for good
reliable information about unicorns.

21
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,990
ELEPHANTS FEET!

22
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:14,600
I still can’t get over it.

23
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,950
INTRO
Today, in our final episode, we examine another

24
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,430
legacy of the most impactful myths: the way
they’ve seeped into the very language I’m

25
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,430
speaking.

26
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,189
We’re going to focus on Greek myths, because
those have had a profound effect on the English

27
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:32,189
language.

28
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:37,850
Though it is true we got a lot of good words
from Egyptian– behemoth, chemistry, PHARMACY!

29
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,369
[[[Thoth acknowledges.]]]

30
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:42,049
You’re welcome - credit where credits due.

31
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:44,299
I mean, you did INVENT WRITING.

32
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:49,390
Anyway - Listing every example of mythical
influence on English would be a ... Herculean

33
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:54,179
task ... a phrase we know from our episode
on Herakles, which implies great difficulty

34
00:01:54,179 --> 00:01:56,580
and a requirement of great strength.

35
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:02,149
And remember, Herakles took nine years to
complete his labors, so a Herculean task can

36
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:06,790
also be one that requires incredible patience,
dedication, and effort.

37
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,949
Speaking of tasks, maybe you’ve heard of
a Sisyphean one?

38
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:12,910
This one’s named after Sisyphus, who we’ve
never discussed.

39
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,580
So this is a perfect Thoughtbubble opportunity.

40
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:21,270
Sisyphus is king of Ephyra, and he’s known
as the craftiest of all men.

41
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,050
Crafty as in sneaky, though, not like... scrapbooking.

42
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:28,000
And Sisyphus isn’t just crafty, he’s also
ruthless.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,640
He invites visitors to his kingdom and then
murders them.

44
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,950
He even plans to kill his own brother, Salmoneus,
by marrying Salmoneus’s daughter Tyro and

45
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,450
making her bear a son who will kill his grandad.

46
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:41,890
Talk about a long con!

47
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:42,890
Jeez.

48
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:47,890
So - in some versions of Sisyphus’ story,
he angers Zeus by claiming to be craftier

49
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,030
than the Father of Gods himself.

50
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,620
In another version, Sisyphus tells the river
Asopus that Zeus is having an affair with

51
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,110
his daughter, the nymph Aegina[a].

52
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:01,890
Every version of Sisyphus’ story has the
doomed king angering one god or another.

53
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:07,070
In some stories he chains up Thanatos, the
god of death, so that no one can die.

54
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:12,560
In other stories he tricks Persephone into
letting him escape the underworld by convincing

55
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,720
her that he wasn’t buried properly.

56
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,720
This guy does not know when to quit.

57
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:21,360
Once he’s finally in Hades for keepsies,
Sisyphus’ punishment is that he’s forced

58
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,540
to roll a huge boulder up a hill in the underworld.

59
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:31,280
Just as he’s about to get it to the top
of the hill, it rolls back down and he has

60
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,140
to start all over again.

61
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,540
Up the hill.

62
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,740
Down the hill.

63
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,740
Forever.

64
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:45,520
And that’s why today we use the term “Sisyphean
task” to mean anything both pointless AND

65
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,520
endless.

66
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,520
Thanks Thoughtbubble.

67
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,940
We can also find a whole trove of linguistic
references by turning to the Iliad and the

68
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,140
Odyssey, two of Greek mythology’s all-time
greats.

69
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,120
In fact, the word “odyssey” is one itself!

70
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,310
You might know that AN odyssey can mean any
long, meandering journey.

71
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:08,830
You have the protagonist of THE Odyssey - Odysseus
- to thank for that particular turn of phrase,

72
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:12,870
although in Greek his name means trouble,
not travel.

73
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,000
Though, given how often my flights are delayed:
I BUY IT.

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,670
Because Odysseus’ Odyssey is such a difficult
journey with so many elements, it gives us

75
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:24,060
a bunch of great ways to describe overcoming
obstacles.

76
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:29,251
Something’s siren song, for instance, describes
its hard-to-resist temptation -- the siren

77
00:04:29,251 --> 00:04:31,770
song of that fifth brownie with lunch.

78
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:38,410
But in the Odyssey this comes from Sirens,
beautiful women who are actually scary half-bird

79
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,430
monsters.

80
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:45,660
Living out at sea, the Sirens have an irresistible
song that lures sailors to their death.

81
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:50,010
Odysseus is warned about this whole situation
by the beautiful witch Circe.

82
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,900
But he decides he just has to hear this song.

83
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,070
I get it - no one wants to be out of the loop
on the hot summer jam.

84
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:04,170
So while his men plug up their ears with wax
and steer the ship, he gets tied to the mast.

85
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:09,760
They sail past the Sirens, and Odysseus can’t
do anything but struggle in vain as his head

86
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,660
is filled with the magical song.

87
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:17,590
And so today, if you tell someone you’re
tying yourself to the mast - it means you

88
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:22,510
see trouble on the horizon, and you’re taking
steps to protect yourself from doing something

89
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,900
you’re gonna regret.

90
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,720
Like having a sixth brownie for lunch.

91
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,530
There’s one more phrase from the Odyssey
that’s worth mentioning, and that’s being

92
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:33,680
caught between Scylla[b] and Charybdis[c],
which is, I promise, a thing that people say.

93
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,420
It’s a much less common version of saying
you’re stuck, “between a rock and a hard

94
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:43,450
place,” except in this situation, it’s
a weird octopus thing and a whirlpool.

95
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:49,250
This is another close shave for Odysseus - because
his route goes directly between these two

96
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,250
beasties.

97
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,889
Scylla is a sea monster that began her life
as a beautiful girl, but was transformed into

98
00:05:53,889 --> 00:06:01,590
a hideous monster with six heads on long necks,
lots of tentacles, and a waist ringed with

99
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,080
dog’s heads.

100
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,900
And just across the narrow strait, less than
an arrow’s shot away?

101
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,900
Is Charybdis.

102
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,270
Charybdis, didn’t start life out as a young
girl.

103
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:15,520
Charybdis is pretty much just a giant whirlpool-mouth-monster
thing.

104
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,180
And all Charybdis does is deliver entire ships
to their doom.

105
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:23,620
So Odysseus gets the heads up from Circe,
who says just sail closer to Scylla.

106
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,650
NO BIG DEAL.

107
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,830
She’s gonna lean over and she’s gonna
gobble up six of your men -- one for each

108
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,380
head -- but c’mon isn’t that better than
losing the whole ship?

109
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:35,770
Odysseus follows her advice, loses six men,
but lives to finish his journey.

110
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:41,830
And so a Scylla and Charybdis isn’t just
about having to make a tough decision -- it’s

111
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,150
knowing that one decision might be right,
even if it costs ya.

112
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:49,240
The Iliad, which is primarily the story of
The Trojan War, also gives us a few turns

113
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,240
of phrase.

114
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,040
At the very start of the Iliad, Paris, the
younger son of Trojan king Priam[d], is asked

115
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:01,130
to choose which goddess is the most beautiful:
Athena, Hera, or Aphrodite.

116
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:07,370
He chooses Aphrodite because she promises
him the most beautiful woman in the world:

117
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,380
Helen of Troy.

118
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:12,420
But Helen is already married to the Greek
king Menelaus[e].

119
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:17,570
Epicly long story short: Paris steals Helen,
or Helen runs away with Paris (depending on

120
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,570
your version).

121
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:24,680
To get Helen back, the Greeks launch some
ships–a thousand, let say–and invade Troy.

122
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,980
Boom: Trojan war.

123
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:32,490
Helen becomes a symbol for unsurpassed beauty
– a face that launched a thousand ships

124
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:37,070
– the type that makes men stupid, although
I suppose it’s possible Paris wasn’t so

125
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,231
bright from the get-go.

126
00:07:38,231 --> 00:07:43,639
The Trojan War to get Helen back goes on for
ten years, nine of which are pretty boring

127
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:46,550
but eventually we get to The Trojan Horse.

128
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:51,880
For years the Greeks have been unable to break
the walls of Troy, so one day they roll a

129
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:56,419
huge wooden horse up to the gates, and leave
it as a “gift”.

130
00:07:56,419 --> 00:08:00,360
Eventually, the Trojans wheel the big horse
inside.

131
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,590
When night falls the super secret hidden Greek
soldiers INSIDE the horse burst out, do some

132
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,240
stabbing and open the gates.

133
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,540
A Trojan horse is now shorthand for a backstab
in the form of a gift.

134
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:16,320
Fun fact: As of recently it was proposed the
Trojan Horse may have been…

135
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,320
REAL!

136
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,070
Except it was a SHIP, left in front of A SEA
GATE!

137
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,199
And speaking of great downfalls!

138
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,610
We also get a phrase from Achilles – one
of the great heroes of the Trojan war.

139
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:31,110
When he was a baby, his mother, Thetis[f],
took him to the river Styx, held him by the

140
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,000
heel, and dipped him in the magical waters.

141
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,429
The contact with the Styx water made Achilles
practically invincible.

142
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:41,438
No one could hurt him in combat.

143
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:45,579
That is, except for the one place on his heel,
where his mother held him.

144
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:49,959
It’s precisely this weak point that Paris
takes advantage of, with a single shot of

145
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:54,360
an arrow at Achilles’ heel, killing the
stalwart Greek hero.

146
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,540
This is why “Achilles heel” can refer
to anyone’s area of vulnerability, often

147
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,819
one that’s SECRET, despite their seeming
resilience.

148
00:09:02,819 --> 00:09:07,749
Let’s be honest though, you’re more likely
to reference the timeless myth of Kal-el,

149
00:09:07,749 --> 00:09:09,059
and call this your Kryptonite.

150
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:13,360
When you start looking, there’re almost
too many myth-inspired phrases to mention.

151
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,839
Take “the Midas touch.”

152
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:19,959
This, of course is from the tale of king Midas,
who wishes for everything he touches to turn

153
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:20,959
to gold.

154
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,499
He gets his wish only to to discover that
gold food isn’t all it’s cracked up to

155
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:26,499
be.

156
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:29,079
And this is kind of ironic, because we tend
to use the phrase “the Midas touch” to

157
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:32,149
refer to people who have success in every
endeavor.

158
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:36,600
Apparently most people only remember the first
part of the story and forget the part about

159
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,720
accidentally turning your daughter into precious
metal and then almost starving to death.

160
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,709
An even more common term is narcissism.

161
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:46,850
This comes from the story of Narcissus, who
was so beautiful that he fell in love with

162
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,990
his own reflection in the water and drowned.

163
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:53,430
Now, we use narcissism to mean pathological
self-involvement.

164
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,850
Oh, also!

165
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:00,339
Before he drowns, he’s so busy loving himself
that he spurns the affection of the nymph

166
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:05,420
... Echo, who is cursed by Juno to speak only
by repeating the words of others.

167
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:10,350
We could go for days with mythological metaphor,
idiom and turns of phrase that’ve found

168
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,569
their way into English!

169
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:16,850
Adonises, gordian knots, leaving no stone
unturned, being MERCURIAL, having a NEMESIS,

170
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,970
or even… a phobia… and tons more.

171
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:24,660
These stories have impacted the very language
we use, and the ways we understand each other,

172
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,100
and much of our culture.

173
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:31,050
At the beginning of the series we established
a definition of myths, saying that they’re

174
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:35,990
meaningful stories with staying power, stories
told for generations.

175
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:40,370
Explaining the mythological origins of common
words and phrases shines a light on how deeply

176
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,530
ingrained they’ve become in our culture.

177
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:48,560
They’re a reminder of how myths, even ones
from millennia ago, remain with us.

178
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,430
You, me, Thoth, we’ve been through a lot
together.

179
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:55,990
We’ve watched sky dad and earth mom fight,
we’ve seen worlds begin and end, we’ve

180
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:02,050
seen Loki be the worst, and witnessed just…
an UNBELIEVABLE amount of weeding.

181
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:05,329
Tigers were ridden, gorgons were defeated,
coyote had some diarrhea.

182
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:06,600
Hey, it happens.

183
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:12,389
We hope you had a good time, learned a thing
or two–about how and why we tell stories,

184
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:16,279
where we find meaning in the world, and why
we seek to create it.

185
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:21,170
Thoth and I are more than proud to have be
your guides on such an awesome journey –

186
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:25,790
Now, before we make our way to that bit of
the Elysian Fields reserved for Crash Course

187
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:29,050
hosts, we want to leave you with a question.

188
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:34,500
What stories of today will become myths tomorrow?

189
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,660
We often think of myths as ancient, but … a
story told over a dozen generations… has

190
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,830
to start somewhere.

191
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:47,199
In a hundred or a thousand years some tales
we’re telling right now may provide our

192
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:52,300
descendents with heroes, tricksters, maybe
even a few monsters.

193
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:58,759
Let’s just hope whatever they are - they
inspire more beauty than battle, more camaraderie

194
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,249
than conflict.

195
00:12:00,249 --> 00:12:05,899
From me, Thoth and the rest of the Crash Course
Myth team: See you soon.

196
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:08,610
So long, and thanks for all the myths.

197
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:12,920
Crash Course Mythology is filmed in the Chad
and Stacey Emigholz studio in Indianapolis,

198
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,810
IN, and is produced with the help of all these
nice people.

199
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,259
Our animation team is Thought Café.

200
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:24,069
Crash Course exists thanks to the generous
support of our patrons at Patreon.

203

time to throw a bacchanal!

204
00:12:34,189 --> 00:12:35,189

IN THE ELYSIAN FIELDS - I’m returning soon
