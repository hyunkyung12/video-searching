00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,340
Hello there! How would you like a ticket to one of
the most influential forms of mass communication
the world has ever known?

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,980
It’s a universal language that lets us tell
stories about our collective hopes and fears,

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,570
to make sense of the world and the people
around us.

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,079
I’m talking about film.

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,040
You probably figured that out because of the title
of this video, but, yeah, I'm talking about film.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:26,030
This powerful medium sits in a sweet spot
of human culture: at the intersection of art,
industry, technology, and politics.

7
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:30,380
It’s inescapable, like FBI piracy warnings,
and trailers that give away the entire movie.

8
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,680
I'm looking at you, Batman v Superman.

9
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,580
And also vs Wonder Woman, apparently,
'cause I learned that from the trailer.

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:41,220
But before we get to a mouse named Mickey,
a little Tramp, and whether or not Han shot first,
we’re going back to the beginning...

11
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,260
In a galaxy far, far–
Well, right here

12
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,900
We have to go all the way back to the beginning
because the creation of this cornerstone of
modern entertainment was basically an accident.

13
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,239
We owe it all to inventors and artists who
were experimenting with new technologies and

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,440
trying to capture snippets of reality, to
see the world in a whole new way.

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,400
I'm Craig Benzine, and this is
Crash Course Film History.

16
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,000
Ready? Lights! Camera! Action!

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,320
Roll the intro now.
We should roll the intro, I think.

18
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:19,260
[Theme Music]

19
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,240
The term “film” was first used to describe
a specific technology –

20
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,380
a thin, flexible material coated in light-sensitive emulsion
that retains an image after it’s exposed to light.

21
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,820
It’s also the end product of that photochemical
process.

22
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,000
A film is a movie.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,940
But it’s also a verb to describe the
process of capturing moving pictures, as in,
“I’m going to film a movie today.”

24
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,960
Or, “Nick is filming me right this very
second.”

25
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,920
Or, "I'm gonna film a film on film."

26
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,420
Over time, the original film technology has
switched to analog and digital substitutes

27
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:48,260
– first things like VHS or Beta, and eventually
digital video, like when you record something
on your phone.

28
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,380
Now, at the very beginning of its history,
before all these innovations existed,

29
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:57,680
film started out as a collection of still images
viewed one after another in rapid succession,
which creates the illusion of motion.

30
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,120
Like what you're seeing right now!

31
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,260
It was a magic trick!

32
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,360
And from that trick came an art form that’s
a blend of literature, drama, photography,
and music.

33
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,280
So how does this illusion actually work?

34
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,760
It all comes down to a couple quirks of human
perception, tricks your eyes play on your brain…
or your brain plays on your eyes… or maybe both.

35
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,280
The 19th century British scholar Peter Mark
Roget was the first to describe one of these
tricks, called Persistence of Vision.

36
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,700
Basically, this is the phenomenon that keeps
you from seeing the black spaces between the
frames of a projected film.

37
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,940
Now, frame can mean a lot of things in film
language, but in this case, it’s what we call one of
the still images that make up a movie.

38
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:34,180
It turns out that if a frame flashes in front
of your eyes, your brain retains that image for
about a fifth of a second after it’s gone.

39
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,220
If another frame appears within that fifth
of a second, your brain won’t register the
black space between them.

40
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,730
You’ll just perceive the next image.

41
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:46,160
So when a film flashes 24 frames per second
in front of your eyes, your brain doesn’t interpret it as
24 images separated by flashes of black.

42
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,100
Instead, it looks like a constant picture.

43
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:55,260
This effect can be combined with another oddity of
perception called the Phi Phenomenon, defined in 1912
by the Czech-born psychologist Max Wertheimer.

44
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,500
Incidentally, "oddity of perception" –
my nickname in high school.

45
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,760
The Phi Phenomenon is an optical illusion
that lets you see a series of images in rapid
succession as continuous motion.

46
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,740
Think of those flip books you played with
as a kid:

47
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:10,680
Take a series of still pictures, shot or drawn
in sequence, flip them quickly before your
eyes and, voilá! The illusion of motion.

48
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,460
You have yourself a “motion picture,”
or a “moving picture.”

49
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,520
In other words, a moving-picturey.

50
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,920
Better yet, a “movie.”
Write that down, that's what we're going with.

51
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:24,040
Now, people have been telling stories since
we’ve had language, and they’ve been using pictures
– even animating them – for almost as long.

52
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,480
One line of thinking traces “movies” all
the way back to cave paintings in places like
Chauvet, France or El Castillo, Spain.

53
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,900
You know – those images of animals, trees,
and human figures, painted on stone walls
as far back as 32,000 years ago.

54
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,480
Scientists think the original artists might
have used flickering torchlight to make them
appear to move.

55
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,220
Fast forward to just 5000 years ago, and we find
people inventing more sophisticated devices to
create that same illusion of motion.

56
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,300
Among these pre-film animation tools,
the ones we’re most familiar with are called
zoetropes.

57
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:54,360
Think of these as a bowl or a deep cylinder
with sequential images painted on the inside
and small slits or windows cut into the edges.

58
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:01,010
Spin the bowl and peer through the slits and
– thanks to Persistence of Vision and the Phi
Phenomenon – the pictures seem to move.

59
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,340
Oooh!

60
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:09,180
Over the centuries, these devices came in
lots of different forms and just as many names:
phenakistoscopes, stroboscopes, stereoscopes...

61
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,580
All kinds of ‘scopes. But not Scope,
the mouthwash – that's something else.

62
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:16,579
And for a long, long time, this is as close
as we ever got to film.

63
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,418
Until photography came along.

64
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,370
Now, it’s important to remember that no one
set out to invent movies.

65
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:26,580
There was no one mastermind, and no
grand plan to revolutionize communication
or art on a global scale.

66
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,940
If I was around, it would've been me,
but there wasn't anyone.

67
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:34,980
Instead, film as we know it today exists
because of a series of happy accidents, technical
innovations, and scientific byproducts.

68
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,420
‘Cause really, at the beginning, nobody
knew what they were doing.

69
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,640
Just like now!

70
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,480
I'm lookin' at you, Batman v Superman.

71
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,680
Photography came about in the early-to-mid-19th
century, at a time of great scientific and artistic innovation.

72
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,400
People of means all over the world were tinkering
in their spare time, playing around with technology

73
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,460
and seeing what they could create, combine,
augment, or transform.

74
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:57,340
Before the photograph was invented, people
were isolating images of the world around
them with devices like the camera obscura.

75
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,880
From the Latin meaning “dark chamber,”
a camera obscura is essentially a box, tent,

76
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,120
or room with a lens or pinhole in one end,
and a reflective surface like a mirror at the other.

77
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,140
Light travels through the hole and displays
an inverted image on the mirror.

78
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:15,640
Like most of these pre-photography technologies, the camera obscura was mostly a novelty, a toy, or sometimes a tool that let artists create images to study or trace.

79
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,320
As the 19th century dawned, folks started
playing around with photosensitive chemicals,

80
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,560
to figure out their properties while trying
not to melt themselves with acid.

81
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,000
Which we should all try to do, in practice.

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,300
In the 1820s, a French inventor named Joseph
Nicéphore Niépce took the first known camera
photograph.

83
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,140
He called it “View from the Window at Le
Gras.”

84
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:36,020
Niépce used a camera obscura to project an image
onto a pewter plate coated in a light-sensitive chemical.

85
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:41,240
The areas of the chemical that were hit
with the brightest light hardened, but the areas
touched by weaker light could be washed away,

86
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,940
so a crude permanent record of the original image survived.

87
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:48,580
Scientists now believe it took a couple days
of exposing the plate to light for the image
to finally show up.

88
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,660
So we’re still a long way from movies!

89
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,860
But we’re getting closer.
Get excited.

90
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:58,080
Louis Daguerre – another Frenchman, and
a close buddy of Niépce – was able to shorten
the exposure time to just a couple of minutes.

91
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,440
His daguerreotype process became the first
commercially-available, mass-market means
of taking photographs in 1839.

92
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,300
And this is usually considered to be
photography’s birthday.

93
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,960
Hooray!
Happy birthday–

94
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,520
But hold on, the daguerreotype still had a
few problems to work out:

95
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,360
the photographs were pretty fragile, they weren’t easy
to replicate, and the chemicals were, shall we say, toxic.

96
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:24,020
Along came George Eastman, an American entrepreneur and the founder of Eastman Kodak, who invented a way of taking pictures on paper, rather than metal or glass plates.

97
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,840
This method also didn’t need as many chemicals,
which probably saved a lot of snap-happy inventors
from health problems.

98
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,280
Now photography was off to the races.

99
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,280
Literally.

100
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,100
So let’s go to the Thought Bubble and see
how photographs were used to pause time and
take a closer look at movement.

101
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,920
Take it away, Thought Bubble! Well, I–
I will take it– I'm gonna narrate, so...

102
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:46,430
In 1872, Leland Stanford, the former governor
of California and a horse race aficionado,

103
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:52,220
made a bet with another bigwig that a horse
at full gallop raises all four hooves off the ground
at some point.

104
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:57,210
To settle the bet, Stanford commissioned a
photographer and inventor named Eadweard Muybridge
to find photographic proof.

105
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:03,220
So, Muybridge set up twelve cameras along
a racetrack, each triggered by a tripwire to capture
a still image of a horse in motion.

106
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:08,380
His set of twelve photos was something brand
new: rapid motion broken down into frozen,
studiable moments.

107
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,640
Spoiler alert – Governor Stanford
won his bet!

108
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,860
There were a couple images where that horse
wasn’t touching the ground at all.

109
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,640
Muybridge’s experiment launched a wave
of “motion studies,”

110
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:22,980
as photographers and inventors all over the world
began using these new technologies to break down
continuous motion into individual images.

111
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,280
And that was one giant step closer to motion
pictures.

112
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,300
Thanks Thought Bubble!
You're so great!

113
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,120
One of those photographers was yet another
Frenchman – a man named Étienne-Jules Marey,

114
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:37,220
whose training in physiology led him to
capture motion studies of birds in flight
and human athletes in action.

115
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:42,040
Instead of tripwires like Muybridge, Marey invented
what he called a chronophotographic gun (awesome)

116
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:47,600
and switched from sheets of photographic paper
to rolls, allowing him to take bursts of photographs
– 12 per second.

117
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:52,480
Even with all these increasingly-fancy techniques,
it’s important to note that these were still just
series of photographs.

118
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:58,300
Motion studies were sometimes projected,
using devices like Muybridge’s zoopraxiscope,
but nobody was trying to make movies yet.

119
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,620
So, the world was boring.

120
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:09,690
Each of these innovations set up Thomas Edison and a scientist who worked for him named W.K.L. Dickson to invent the kinetograph – the world’s first motion picture film camera.

121
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:15,580
And they, in turn, paved the way for the first
filmmakers to experiment with motion picture
technologies and storytelling.

122
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:21,060
We mentioned earlier that film is an illusion,
but it’s an illusion that’s carefully crafted by people
who want to show a specific point of view.

123
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,200
With aesthetic choices – from shot angle
and shot size to lens type and lighting style

124
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:30,020
and how much hair you put on a wookie –
filmmakers can further affect how we, as an
audience, interpret reality.

125
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,860
In a real sense, film wasn’t invented,
it was stumbled upon.

126
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:39,100
A series of happy accidents eventually led
us to Citizen Kane, Grand Illusion, Black Girl,
and the experimental works of Stan Brackage.

127
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:44,159
Not to mention, things like The Wizard of Oz,
Raiders of the Lost Ark, Captain America: Civil War,
and Sharknado!

128
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,640
There’s a whole world of film out there
to discover, and there’s a lot that film can
help you discover about yourself too.

129
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,120
And that’s the story we’ll continue, next
time we meet.

130
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,280
Today we talked about how film is a sort of
magic trick, thanks to the ways our eyes and
brains work.

131
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,660
Thank you eyes and brains!

132
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:01,520
We introduced the very, very beginnings of
film, when people started using sequential
images to tell stories.

133
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,630
We discussed photography as a huge technological
leap forward, since chemicals and light could

134
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,850
capture images and break down fast-moving
reality like never before.

135
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:13,920
And next time, we’ll learn about the very
first motion picture cameras, and the start
of movies as we know them now.

136
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,820
