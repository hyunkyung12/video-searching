1
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,750
Movies come in all shapes and sizes.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:10,180
Some are big and loud and thrilling, while
others are small, finely crafted gems.

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,570
And there are few love stories as soft-spoken
and full of soul as Sofia Coppola’s Lost

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:15,570
in Translation.

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,700
It’s a movie that sneaks up on you, using
artistry that feels so natural that the precision

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,550
of its craft is only clear if you think about
it afterward.

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,890
This film also wrestles with complex questions
about modern consumer culture and how cinema

8
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,500
can authentically portray a woman’s point
of view.

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,990
And did I mention it’s funny too?

10
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,120
Even as it tugs at your heart.

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:46,000
[intro music plays]

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,820
Writer-director Sofia Coppola had only made

13
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:51,220
one feature film before she began working
on Lost in Translation.

14
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:55,149
That film, The Virgin Suicides, was based
on a book by Jeffrey Eugenides.

15
00:00:55,149 --> 00:01:00,170
It tells the story of the mysterious and doomed
Lisbon sisters in 1974 Detroit, as remembered

16
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,360
by the neighborhood boys some forty years
later.

17
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:07,180
It’s a complex, dreamy movie that establishes
Coppola as a master of tone, perspective,

18
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,180
and imagery.

19
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,330
With Lost in Translation, Coppola both expanded
her scope – exploring the eclectic world

20
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,700
of contemporary Japan – while also focusing
the drama on two central characters.

21
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,450
Scarlett Johansson plays Charlotte, a 20-year-old
woman who’s come to Tokyo with her rock-and-roll

22
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,850
photographer husband, played by Giovanni Ribisi.

23
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:27,590
A recent college graduate and philosophy major,
Charlotte is adrift – not only in this foreign

24
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,770
city, but in her marriage, and even her life.

25
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,440
Bob Harris is a movie star.

26
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,310
Or… he was a movie star.

27
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:37,830
Now he flies to Tokyo to spend a week shilling
for a high-profile Japanese whisky company

28
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,700
– recording commercials, making talk show
appearances, and suffering from insomnia.

29
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,780
In one of the film’s many ironies, Bob is
played by Bill Murray, who was once a major

30
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:46,850
movie star himself.

31
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,830
Unlike Bob, Murray has emerged from the
height of his fame into a late career full

32
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:54,010
of meaty roles that are often as sorrowful
as they are funny.

33
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,810
And his Bob Harris is no exception.

34
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,229
This film is patient.

35
00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:01,479
We spend a lot of time getting to know Charlotte
and Bob alone before they ever meet each other.

36
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:05,479
We see them trapped in the interior spaces
of their luxury hotel, dealing with spouses

37
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:08,979
who don’t seem to be on the same wavelength,
and mesmerized by the lights and sounds of

38
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:09,979
the city.

39
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,250
When they do start to interact with one
another, it’s tentative.

40
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,590
A smile in an elevator.

41
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,260
A look across a crowded lounge.

42
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,270
And eventually, a brief conversation at the
bar.

43
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,050
When Charlotte’s husband heads out of town
for a few days to work, Charlotte asks Bob

44
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,250
to come out with her and some of her Japanese
friends.

45
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,270
The two have an easy, funny rapport.

46
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,000
They seem to recognize something in one
another, like kindred spirits.

47
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,440
Charlotte: So, what are you doing here?

48
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,540
Bob: A couple of things.

49
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,100
Bob: Taking a break from my wife. Forgetting my son's birthday.

50
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:45,540
Bob: And getting paid two-million dollars to endorse a whiskey, when I could be doing a play somewhere.

51
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,960
Charlotte is an old soul, and Johansson plays

52
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,180
her with an effortless, mournful charm that
belies her youth.

53
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,420
Bob begins the film as a sad sack, until Charlotte
draws out his youthful charisma.

54
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,850
And Murray makes both sides of his character
feel genuine, funny, and moving.

55
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,550
As their relationship deepens, the movie never
quite goes where we expect.

56
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,379
Bob and Charlotte comfort and confide in one
another, essentially falling in love.

57
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:09,920
But they never cross the line into a physical
affair.

58
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,970
Although we do see them struggling to figure
out how physical love fits into their connection.

59
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,770
Near the end of the film, they share an awkward
set of goodnight kisses in an elevator.

60
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:21,290
But they seem to be grappling with what’s
expected of them, rather than any deep-seated

61
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,290
sexual desire.

62
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:26,060
In fact, the one thing that ruptures the bubble
of their relationship is when Bob sleeps with

63
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,000
an over-the-top lounge singer.

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,230
But Charlotte seems just as upset by his betrayal
as she is by the fact that she feels jealousy

65
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,220
at all.

66
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,940
Charlotte: Well, she is closer to your age.

67
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,540
In the film’s now-famous climactic scene,
Bob catches a glimpse of Charlotte from the

68
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,360
car on his way to the airport.

69
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,660
Feeling unsatisfied in their initial goodbye,
he leaps out of the car, runs across traffic,

70
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,830
and catches up with her.

71
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:50,709
They embrace, clinging to each other for a
brief moment, and then Bob whispers something

72
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:51,780
in Charlotte’s ear.

73
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,880
And we don’t get to hear it!

74
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,940
But... it must’ve been good.

75
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,190
Because when Bob gets back in his car and
as Charlotte walks away, they both seem more

76
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,060
content, as if a weight has been lifted.

77
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,390
It’s like their connection will somehow
last as they navigate the rest of their lives

78
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,600
and relationships.

79
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,960
The ultimate bittersweet ending.

80
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,349
Now, our job as critics isn’t just to figure
out what a film means.

81
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:12,330
It’s also to figure out how that meaning
is created.

82
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:16,470
Writing in Quarterly Review of Film and Video,
critic and scholar Todd McGowan makes a compelling

83
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,260
case for reading Lost in Translation as a
critique of global capitalism.

84
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:20,760
That’s right.

85
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:21,769
Capitalism.

86
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:22,930
we’re going there!

87
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,059
He writes, “Bob and Charlotte are able to
connect during their stay … precisely because

88
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:32,319
they each realize that the excess that bombards
them throughout Tokyo conceals a fundamental

89
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,319
absence.”

90
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:36,419
Throughout the film, both characters seem
to be alienated from the bustling city that

91
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:37,419
surrounds them.

92
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:41,960
Bob gazes in wonder the neon lights of Tokyo
in the opening scene, utterly overwhelmed.

93
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,139
And Charlotte is frequently sitting at her
hotel window, looking out at the city’s

94
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:47,160
urban sprawl, as if it’s all too much.

95
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,090
And when she does go out, the film assaults
us with the loud noises of an arcade, the

96
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,599
blaring music of a bar, and the cacophony
of some intense Tokyo traffic.

97
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:57,949
But when she finds moments away from it
all, she seems more at peace.

98
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:02,480
Like, in a quiet hallway outside a karaoke
lounge, at a shrine hidden in the city, or

99
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,490
when she stumbles across women practicing
ikebana, the Japanese art

100
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,599
of flower arrangement.

101
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:08,770
Bob is even more steeped in excess.

102
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,009
He’s even a part of it!

103
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:13,909
His picture is plastered all over billboards
and the sides of buses.

104
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:15,759
His old movies play on TV.

105
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,439
And he participates in a loud, garish Japanese
talk show.

106
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:22,710
He also keeps getting messages from his wife
back home in Los Angeles, with questions about

107
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,699
colors, fabrics, and decor as she remodels
his office.

108
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:30,780
Eventually, a FedEx box arrives with carpet
swatches – a dozen, basically indistinguishable

109
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,099
shades of burgundy.

110
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:36,039
The moment is played for laughs, but it only
increases Bob’s sense of being overwhelmed

111
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:37,080
by commerce.

112
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,389
So what does all this excess mean?

113
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:44,330
McGowan suggests that our desire for excessive
things and experiences is actually a product

114
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,169
of a global capitalist system.

115
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:50,069
And that system only functions when we’re
constantly hungry for more.

116
00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:54,279
By this interpretation, Lost in Translation
is a film about unsatisfaction.

117
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:56,490
Bob is unsatisfied in his work.

118
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,169
Charlotte doesn’t even know where to start.

119
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:00,249
And they’re both unsatisfied in their marriages.

120
00:06:00,249 --> 00:06:05,690
At the same time, both of their spouses personify
the quest for excess – from Bob’s wife’s

121
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,599
focus on the carpet squares, to how Charlotte’s
husband relishes his role as a photographer

122
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:11,419
promoting glamor and music.

123
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:16,219
In McGowan’s reading, our heroes connect
by rejecting a never-ending quest for material

124
00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:17,360
satisfaction.

125
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,499
And they fill their lives with small, quiet
moments instead.

126
00:06:20,499 --> 00:06:25,249
In a sense, they find meaning and forge their
relationship in absence, not excess.

127
00:06:25,249 --> 00:06:30,490
They find joy in spontaneity, like a race
across traffic, an off-key karaoke performance,

128
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,399
or an unexpected ikebana ceremony.

129
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,009
These moments can’t be planned, can’t
be replicated, and – most importantly – can’t

130
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:37,009
be bought.

131
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:40,789
This focus on the power of absence is felt
throughout the film, which follows the pattern

132
00:06:40,789 --> 00:06:44,039
of a traditional romance, from the meet-cute
to the climactic trip to the airport.

133
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:48,180
But at each major turn, the story withholds
key romantic beats.

134
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,879
Like, Bob and Charlotte never consummate their
relationship.

135
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,599
Or when Bob races after Charlotte in the final
scene, he’s not doing it to sweep her off

136
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:56,389
her feet for a happily ever after.

137
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:59,620
And his whisper is the ultimate expression
of absence.

138
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:04,089
The film builds to a climax that withholds
the final piece of information from us, and

139
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:07,280
in doing so, gives that absence incredible value.

140
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,140
It's also really important to note that this is a film about outsiders in Japan.

141
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:15,240
Directed by Sophia Coppola, an American who's an outsider herself.

142
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,240
And because of that, something else gets lost in translation.

143
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,440
This movie relies on some cultural stereotypes for comedy and plot.

144
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,660
For instance, the call girl who tries to talk
to Bob in broken English is a caricature — the

145
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:29,909
audience is meant to laugh at her mispronunciation,
which doesn’t have any other purpose in

146
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:30,909
the story.

147
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:35,349
And while ancient traditions, like temples
or ikebana, are glorified, the film also implies

148
00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:39,229
that many modern Japanese people have forsaken
these “good” parts of their culture for

149
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:40,879
ridiculous excess.

150
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,479
Which is a really reductive perspective.

151
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,419
So even if it wasn’t intended, this movie
sometimes uses Japan as a backdrop and Japanese

152
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:51,719
people as gags in ways that reinforce stereotypes,
which can be harmful.

153
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:55,319
Now, it’s also worth looking at the characters
and relationship in Lost in Translation through

154
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,319
a feminist lens.

155
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,569
The year it was released, Sofia Coppola became
the third woman ever nominated for a Best

156
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:01,580
Director Oscar.

157
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,879
And Todd Kennedy makes the case in the journal
Film Criticism that Coppola’s films seem

158
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:08,909
to be building a feminine, if not feminist,
film form.

159
00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:13,330
The foundational text of feminist film criticism
by theorist and filmmaker Laura Mulvey,

160
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:17,709
argues that mainstream cinema is overwhelmingly
films made by men, for men.

161
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:21,039
In these films, women are usually objects
of desire or derision.

162
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,839
In other words, they’re eye candy, or someone
to laugh at.

163
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,090
The camera takes the point of view of the
male gaze, putting audiences in the perspectives

164
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,289
of the male characters within the film as
they – and by extension we – look at

165
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:33,289
the women.

166
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:37,208
Kennedy argues that Sofia Coppola cleverly
uses the language, grammar, and tropes of

167
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:42,679
mainstream cinema and the male gaze to force
us to step back and consider our expectations

168
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,339
and complicity in that form.

169
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:47,800
A great example is the first shot of the film,
in which Scarlett Johansson is photographed

170
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,110
from behind and from the neck down, lying
on a bed.

171
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,269
She’s in a sweater and vaguely translucent
panties.

172
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:55,730
Kennedy writes, “This shot would seem to
match Mulvey’s description of a typical

173
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:02,220
Hollywood scene in which the camera is active/masculine
and the female character is passive/feminine—an

174
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,220
object of desire.”

175
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:08,470
However, Coppola holds the shot for thirty-six
seconds, which is forever in film time,

176
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,220
before the title of the film shows up.

177
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:14,760
And Kennedy goes on: “What is interesting
about this shot is that it lasts so long as

178
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:20,160
to become awkward—forcing the audience to
become aware of (and potentially even question)

179
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,899
their participation in the gaze.”

180
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:26,190
Time and again, the film inverts the usual
Hollywood presentation of women on screen.

181
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,440
Charlotte appears half-dressed a number of
times throughout the film, but these images

182
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,569
aren’t sexualized.

183
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:34,329
Instead, we’re asked to gaze with her
at the world outside her window.

184
00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:38,319
So while the outward aesthetic is familiar
to mainstream cinema, our perspective doesn’t

185
00:09:38,319 --> 00:09:39,920
slip into the male gaze tropes.

186
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,430
And these are just a couple examples of how
Coppola’s central female character is allowed

187
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,529
to be a whole, complex human.

188
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:49,610
Charlotte is wrapped up in a warm, funny,
bittersweet film that never condescends to

189
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:53,310
her for a laugh, and has got a lot more going
on than just pretty pictures.

190
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:57,190
Next time, we’ll take a journey with Sofia’s
father into the heart of darkness itself,

191
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,100
the Vietnam War as seen through the film Apocalypse
Now.

192
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,440
