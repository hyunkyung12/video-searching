00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,760
Hi, I'm Mike Rugnetta, this is crash course mythology and today, we're gonna finish up our heroes series by telling the story of a great hero.

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,560
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:16,420
Okay, not really. The Rock may be the sexiest man alive, but he's no demigod like Ma'ui,

4
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:21,000
The demigod hero of Oceania, and the role he recently voiced in the film, Moana.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,500
The legendary Ma'ui is pretty different from his cartoon counterpart.

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:33,880
He's younger, more lithe, and a little smarter. Still, he's an adventurer, he has a divine birth, he's a trickster, and a culture hero.

7
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,020
He's everything we love here at Crash Course.

8
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:43,500
*Crash Course Intro Music*

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,520
Ma'ui myths are found throughout Oceania, particularly in Hawaii. Like Heracles, the most well-known Ma'ui stories focus on a series of heroic deeds.

10
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:02,380
But where Heracles spent the vast majority of his labours killing, or stealing monstrous animals,

11
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:09,220
Ma'ui's great deeds are a little more motley. He fights a monstrous eel, but he also gets into an argument with the sun!

12
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,180
He creates the entire island of New Zealand.

13
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:19,580
Some stories characterize Ma'ui as a hero, and some of them work aetiologically to explain aspects of the natural world.

14
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:30,680
And others capture the mythic origins of Pacific Islander culture, and also unlike Heracles, these tasks are not assigned to Ma'ui as one big hero project.

15
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,280
They occur throughout his life and act as episodic glimpses into Oceania's culture.

16
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:43,380
But, okay. Enough treading water. Without further ado, Ma'ui's seven great deeds.

17
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,600
One: Fighting his mom's house. Not fighting in his mom's house,

18
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,720
fighting the house. Back in the mythic times of Oceania lived a goddess named Hina of the fire.

19
00:01:54,740 --> 00:02:02,170
She had four sons and all of them were named Maui. One day she gives birth to a fifth named, you guessed it

20
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:07,449
Maui. This Maui, they call him Maui the skillful, is our hero.

21
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:12,820
But to Hina of the fire he's one too many mouths to feed. So she sets Maui five

22
00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:14,900
adrift at sea.

23
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,820
It just, you know, it wouldn't be a myth without just a little attempted infanticide.

24
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:23,320
You know? Luckily for Maui five ,the god of the sea takes favor on him

25
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:28,989
and he survives the waves and currents of the ocean. He makes it all the way back to Hina of the fire's house.

26
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:34,600
She can't believe it and doubling down on her motherly abandonment,

27
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,379
she says that she'll only take him back if he proves his worth.

28
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,339
He must destroy her house by throwing

29
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:49,630
spears through its thatched roof. If you remember the Muendo(?) epic, this kind of radical remodeling should sound familiar.

30
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,979
Maui squares off against the house, beginning the fearsome battle where our hero defeats two

31
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,180
terrible

32
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,230
doorposts. He strikes down short post and tall post,

33
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:05,400
his mother, for whatever reason, is finally proud of her son and welcomes him, um,

34
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,280
home? Welcomes him to a pile of thatching? Either way heroic deed done. Two:

35
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:19,359
Raising the sky. Maui eventually gets a home, but things aren't all hunky-dory. In those days the sky that stretched over

36
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,960
Oceania was very very low. We're talking

37
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:29,320
scraping the tops of trees low. Clouds blocking all the light low. Maui decides to do something about this.

38
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:35,829
He gets a swig of some mystery drink out of a strange lady's gourd which fills him with enough magical strength to lift up

39
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:41,980
the whole sky. Though, palm tree leaves are still flat to this day from the time when the sky

40
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:48,640
pressed down on them. With all the new room Maui fashions a kite. He calls for help from a nearby wizard and a few

41
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:49,660
incantations later,

42
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:57,130
there's a great magical wind. In fact the winds are so strong that they snap Maui's line and blow his kite away.

43
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:00,490
But during the struggle Maui learns to read the winds and

44
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:07,839
understand the weather. Which he passes on to the people of the islands and now they can travel further than ever before. Three:

45
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,490
Fishing for New Zealand. Maui

46
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,960
might have sorted out the sky

47
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:18,399
but he was still the youngest brother. His older brothers all thought Maui the skillful was actually Maui the lazy and Maui the

48
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:25,960
bad at fishing. They teased him and tattled on him to Hina of the fire. Maui decides he is gonna prove his brothers wrong!

49
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,770
He travels to the underworld to make contact with a long-dead

50
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,399
ancestor. This ancestor is half dead and half alive,

51
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,179
so they give Maui the jawbone out of their dead half,

52
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,089
which he carves into a magical fish hook.

53
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:46,359
Then he goes and catches one of his mother's sacred Alae birds to use as bait. Now,

54
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:51,609
he's ready to go fishing. Maui five and his brothers row out farther than anyone has ever gone,

55
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,720
and they begin to fish. His brothers begin complaining about his laziness,

56
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,690
but then,

57
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:01,809
something catches on Maui's hook. The brothers gather around and helped Maui pull and

58
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,049
pull and rather than pull up a fish they pull up an

59
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,619
entire island. And after this his brothers stopped calling Maui lazy. Also. We get Lorde!

60
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,810
I mean we may never be Royals, but perhaps

61
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,460
heroes? Four:

62
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,960
Slow the Sun now he's third task was good for his reputation

63
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:27,039
But his fourth task is important for everyone on the Pacific Islands they all enjoyed the new room under the sky

64
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:34,059
But there's one problem the Sun streaks across it so fast that no one has any time to do any work

65
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,770
No one can tan hides

66
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,740
and there's not enough light to create tapa cloth a

67
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,030
handmade patterned textile

68
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:47,800
Constructed from trees and trust me tapa cloth is a big deal Heena of the fire comes to her son and asks him

69
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,639
Will you do this deed will you slow down the Sun?

70
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:57,280
She thinks there is no way he's gonna pull it off. But now he has learned a thing or two about

71
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:03,430
Asking for help he goes to his grandmother, and she tells him the Sun is so fast because it has

72
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,440
16 legs

73
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:13,090
If you have any hope of catching it you must set that many traps one snare for each leg

74
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,790
she gives Maui a magical stone ax

75
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,219
Once you've smeared the Sun use this to get your way now

76
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,720
He sets the snares and snags the Sun. He approaches it brandishing the magic

77
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,720
Axe he threatens it saying he will strike it down

78
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:34,119
Unless it agrees to take a dang time and give the people a chance to go about their day the Sun agrees

79
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,020
The day lengthens and people are much happier now

80
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,090
He then gets to go back to his doubtful mom and decree

81
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,410
What can I say except you're welcome my five?

82
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:51,309
Winning fire for Humanity many cultures have stories about discovering fire or stealing it from Supernatural sources think

83
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:56,349
Prometheus or grandmother spider or Loki who is the worst, but occasionally useful to have around?

84
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,030
So this is all to say Maui's fifth task might sound familiar now

85
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:07,599
We dealt with the too cramped sky, and the too fast Sun but the people of Oceania still don't have fire now

86
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,719
He knows his mother Hina of the fire possesses its secret

87
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:17,290
But she's not talking so Maui decides to go over her head and journeys once again to the underworld there

88
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:24,340
He tracks down his great-great grandmother ma Hui. Ah and convinces her to give him the secret of fire ma

89
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:29,569
Hua reaches down and pull one of her fingernails in which burns a tiny fire

90
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:34,610
She tells him take this back to the surface and you can spread the fire to all

91
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,949
Humanity Maui is very grateful and begins to head back, but on the way

92
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,760
drops the nail into a stream ah

93
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:51,320
Let's head to the thought-bubble to see how Maui gets himself out of this heroic pickle now. He goes back and tells ma

94
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:58,010
Hooyah who shakes her head and gives him another fingernail. He turns around heads back and drops it into a stream again

95
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,480
ah so back

96
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:06,170
He goes and he asks again and the same thing happens it happens again with all of the rest of her fingernails and men her

97
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:12,380
Toenails man what a klutz when Maui comes for her last toenail ma Hui odd gets so angry

98
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:17,089
That she throws it on the ground and sets the underworld on fire now

99
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:21,350
He turns and Sprint's out of the underworld chased by the roaring flames

100
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:28,970
The fire burns underneath the earth and all the water boils Maui chants a magic incantation that brings rain

101
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:36,859
To put out the fires after the rain stops Mejia gathers up the last remnants of the fire and hides it in

102
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:41,090
Tiny pieces in the Bark's of different trees after this fiasco

103
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:47,599
Maui and his brothers see the Ailey birds who belonged to their mother making fires to cook their food

104
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,520
But every time the brothers get near the Ailee put out their fire and fly away

105
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:58,039
Realizing that the birds must know where the fire is hidden now he concocts a plan now

106
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,520
He makes a dummy of himself and props it up in his community

107
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,919
He pushes the canoe out into the water and hides the birds see his dummy sail away

108
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,190
And whip up a fire to cook their bananas now

109
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:17,059
He leaps from his hiding spot and grabs the oldest Ailee burned shaking it by the neck and demanding to know the secret of fire

110
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,729
Finally it spills the fiery beans

111
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:26,780
Rub together the bark of the how and the sandalwood trees, and you'll always be able to make fire

112
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,229
That's a big old fiery check. Thank you thought bubble

113
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:37,219
Six kun aloha the long eel Maui's sixth deed is a quicken the long

114
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,700
eel kun Aloha is

115
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,540
terrorising he of the fire so Maui kills it and

116
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:48,890
Chops it up into many pieces all the pieces squirm around and become fish and other eels and that explains why there's so many fish

117
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:54,830
In the seas around the Pacific Islands boom fish chicken of the sea check seven

118
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:59,900
immortality last episode Heracles was promised immortality if he finished his Labor's for

119
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,689
Maui's final task he aims even higher

120
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,450
He wants to gain immortality not only for himself

121
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,270
but

122
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:14,210
All of humanity it all starts when Maui learns about the Goblin got us Hina Nui keepo who brings death to all creatures?

123
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,999
Now he hears that if he can steal her heart and give it out to the creatures of Earth. They'll all become

124
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:28,369
Immortal, but now he is scared the goddess is more powerful than anything he's tussled with so he asks the ailee

125
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:35,150
If they'll come and be his backup he explains to the birds when the goddess is asleep. We're gonna creep in through

126
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,960
her mouth

127
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,960
past her vulcanic a glass teeth

128
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:47,270
Down to her heart to steal it, but when we're inside you can't make a sound not a single

129
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,070
First

130
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:55,640
Everything goes according to plan now. He makes it past the goddesses jaws through her stomach and grabs her heart

131
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:02,000
he turns around climbs back towards freedom and just as he makes it to her mouth a

132
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:08,630
Bird tweets the goddess wakes up instantly and feels Maui in her mouth she bites down and there

133
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:17,510
Now he dies so now he fails his final task, but maybe in this case the failure is the lesson

134
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:23,090
Immortality sounds nice, but it isn't meant for humans, or as Thoth, and I sometimes call them mortals

135
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,789
Maybe it's better to learn to accept our own mortality

136
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:30,679
Lest we get chomped by a goddess Maui is kind of a curious figure sometimes

137
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:35,659
capable sometimes clumsy sometimes strong sometimes scared sometimes clever sometimes dumb

138
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,779
He and Heracles have more than a few things in common

139
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:45,380
I'd say they both do impossible deeds sure but they're not one-trick heroes either look at you Aquaman

140
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,390
Just kidding Jason Momoa is gonna. Crush it

141
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:54,889
This is one of the things that sets studying mythology apart from studying literature or fiction when your hero is a mythological hero

142
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:58,219
It means they've been constructed by entire cultures sometimes

143
00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:01,698
multiple cultures and passed down orally over

144
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:08,269
Generations that's very different than a character whipped up by a professional screenwriter and voiced by the rock

145
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:13,128
We can't look to myths for the same storytelling experience that we get from a Disney cartoon

146
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:20,449
But myths and their variations allow us to think about what stories come into being and why they remain popular

147
00:12:20,819 --> 00:12:22,499
Whether the stories are about

148
00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:29,538
Discovering fire creating new zeland or just getting in a fight with your mom's door jamb and winning check next week

149
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:35,659
It's time for a big transition. We're moving on to mythical places. Thanks for watching and see you in Eton
