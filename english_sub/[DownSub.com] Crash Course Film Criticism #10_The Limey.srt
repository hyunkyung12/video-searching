1
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:12,700
Some films tell intricate stories filled with
twists — like the search for truth in

2
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,820
All the President’s Men
the dark tangents of Mulholland Drive,

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,410
, or the trippy lunacy of Being John Malkovich.

4
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,820
Other times, the story is very simple, while
the telling is remarkably complex.

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,720
Steven Soderbergh’s 1999 film The Limey
is one of those movies.

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,980
By using unusual or even experimental techniques,
filmmakers can draw out the themes of a film

7
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,620
and challenge viewers to look at cinema in
a whole new way.

8
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,620
From its scrambled timeline to its occasionally
avant garde editing style, The Limey takes

9
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,150
a familiar plot and layers it with deeper
meaning.

10
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:45,180
This film shows how movies, more than any
other medium, can mirror the ways our minds

11
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,780
work and how memories unfold.

12
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,600
I'm Michael Aranda, this is Crash Course Film Criticism, and I have a cold.

13
00:00:50,600 --> 00:01:03,480
[intro music plays]

14
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,560
In 1998, Steven Soderbergh had just finished

15
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,670
directing Out of Sight, the sexy crime thriller
starring George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez.

16
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,229
And he was gearing up to make Erin Brockovich
and win a Best Director Oscar for Traffic.

17
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:17,049
But before scaling the heights of mainstream
Hollywood, he turned his attention to a little

18
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:22,440
revenge thriller written by Lem Dobbs, best
known for writing the sci-fi noir cult hit, Dark City.

19
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,460
The Limey follows a British thief named Wilson,
played with steely conviction by Terence Stamp.

20
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,240
He travels to Los Angeles fresh from prison
to investigate the death of his daughter Jenny.

21
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,590
The thing is, Wilson’s been incarcerated
for most of Jenny’s life.

22
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,729
He barely knows her.

23
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:36,920
So he starts filling in the gaps.

24
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,100
He gets help from Eduardo, a fellow ex-con
played by Luis Guzman.

25
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,760
Eduardo knew Jenny and becomes Wilson’s
reluctant sidekick.

26
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,570
Wilson also connects with Elaine, a former
actress and mentor of Jenny’s, played with

27
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,259
tragic grace by Leslie Ann Warren.

28
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,009
The trail ultimately points to Terry Valentine,
a former music producer who was dating Jenny

29
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:55,090
at the time of her death.

30
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,299
Played by Peter Fonda, Valentine is a vapid,
charming sleaze-ball.

31
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:02,039
He’s recently started laundering money for
a drug cartel to make ends meet.

32
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:05,979
Wilson spends the movie circling his target,
investigating Jenny’s death, and avoiding

33
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:07,799
a pair of hitmen hired to take him out.

34
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,010
There are flashes of violence, moments of
deadpan humor, and a galvanizing 1960s soundtrack.

35
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:17,150
The final gun battle at Valentine’s beach
house in Big Sur, California leaves most of

36
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,150
Valentine’s crew dead or dying.

37
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:24,260
Eventually, Wilson chases a wounded Valentine
to a rocky beach, and he gets the whole story.

38
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,629
Jenny had discovered Valentine’s illegal
activities and threatened to turn him in.

39
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:32,599
Valentine panicked and tried to stop her,
and in their struggle, she struck her head

40
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,599
and died.

41
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,730
Wilson remembers Jenny threatening to call
the cops on him when she was a young girl

42
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,170
— without ever following through on her
threats.

43
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:43,680
And, in that moment, he recognizes that he
played a part in her death.

44
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,200
He leaves Valentine bleeding on the beach
as the tide comes rolling in.

45
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,200
And that’s it.

46
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,540
It’s a pretty familiar plot, but Soderbergh
saw something else buried inside the tropes.

47
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:57,340
For him, The Limey was a deep, introspective
story about memory, regret, and forgiveness.

48
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,530
And Soderbergh thought that he knew how to
shoot and edit the film in ways that would

49
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,549
make these themes central to the experience
of watching it.

50
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:06,890
Basically, he thought he could cut the movie
so that it felt like a memory.

51
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:10,439
And when you’re critiquing a film, it can
be helpful to take a magnifying glass to the

52
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:11,940
filmmakers’ choices and techniques.

53
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,560
By doing that with The Limey, we can figure
out how Soderbergh adds layers of complexity

54
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,780
to the characters and plot of a classic revenge
story, and the ways he carefully controls

55
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,030
how the audience experiences it all.

56
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:27,409
Now, as we talked about in Crash Course Film
History, most films are edited using an strategy

57
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:29,060
called
continuity editing.

58
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,280
That means that most of the cuts are seamless,
or even invisible.

59
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,620
The edits are designed to make the film’s
time and space clear.

60
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,890
They don’t interrupt the action, and time
generally moves forward.

61
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,750
The Limey takes another approach.

62
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:45,200
From the first few shots, Soderbergh and editor
Sarah Flack opt for a strategy called

63
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,659
discontinuity editing.

64
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,750
Here, the edits deliberately draw attention.

65
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,189
The filmmakers cut back and forth within or
between scenes, without actually telling us

66
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:55,970
how they fit into the film’s timeline or
geography.

67
00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:00,160
This fragments the narrative and forces the
audience into a more active role.

68
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,159
We have to really watch the movie and piece
it together.

69
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,209
It’s like solving a puzzle, which is exactly
what Wilson’s up to!

70
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:10,780
As the film progresses, we get shots of Wilson
sitting and thinking – in an airplane, unpacking

71
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,689
in his hotel room, turning on the shower,
then back to him on the plane, staring out

72
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:14,689
the window.

73
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:15,689
Did he get back on the plane?

74
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:16,689
Did he ever leave?

75
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:17,689
Is this a memory?

76
00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:18,689
A fantasy?

77
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:19,689
A flash-forward?

78
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:21,829
The movie sets up a kind of dissonance between
sound, image, and time.

79
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:25,210
The filmmakers scramble these elements to
get at something deeper in their story.

80
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,740
All these cross-cut shots of Wilson give the
film a much more contemplative tone than your

81
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,250
average revenge thriller.

82
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,900
And as soon as we’re used to those, the
film deploys even more sophisticated discontinuity

83
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,080
editing techniques.

84
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,639
Soderbergh and Flack start cutting to heavily
stylized shots of a young girl on a beach.

85
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,590
She looks right at the camera, a circle of
reflected light flashing over her face.

86
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,380
This is Jenny, refracted through Wilson’s
memory.

87
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,960
It’s an almost ghostly image — imperfect,
sad, yet beautiful.

88
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,229
And these memory shots lead to other flashbacks,
often without dialogue.

89
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:59,430
They’re of a convict that looks remarkably
like a young Terence Stamp trying to maintain

90
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,639
a relationship with a woman and their daughter.

91
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,419
Turns out, it is a much younger Terence
Stamp!

92
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:10,550
Soderbergh had the idea to use a 1967 film
by Ken Loach called Poor Cow to show Wilson’s

93
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,550
backstory.

94
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,370
That film follows a single mother played by
Carol White as she struggles to make a life

95
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,150
for herself while dealing with a troubled
young thief played by Stamp.

96
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:23,419
Soderbergh not only uses these shots to fill
in the gaps of Wilson’s backstory, but also

97
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:27,250
to highlight The Limey’s connections to
bold British cinema of the 1960s.

98
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:32,270
In 1967, director John Boorman made Point
Blank, an aggressively non-linear revenge

99
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,949
thriller about a double-crossed criminal left
for dead.

100
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:39,860
Richard Lester’s Petulia from 1968 uses
discontinuity editing to reflect the scrambled,

101
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,979
quirky nature of the characters’ experiences.

102
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:46,410
Inspired by these and other films, Soderbergh
has played with non-linear storytelling in

103
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:50,360
everything from his debut film, sex, lies,
and videotape, to Out of Sight.

104
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,720
But nothing comes close to the fractured quality
of The Limey.

105
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,460
Two sequences especially illustrate how far
Soderbergh and Flack are willing to push the envelope.

106
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,380
Early in the film, Wilson visits Elaine and
takes her out to dinner.

107
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:04,849
She tells him about Jenny, painting a picture
of his daughter’s life in LA.

108
00:06:04,849 --> 00:06:08,960
And he shares a heartrending story about how
he knew she’d died, before he’d been told.

109
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,420
It’s a straightforward conversation that
deepens our understanding of Jenny, her difficult

110
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,819
relationship with Wilson, and Wilson’s growing
intimacy with Elaine.

111
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:20,020
But instead of shooting the conversation in
a conventional, linear way, Soderbergh decided

112
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:25,000
to film it in three different locations: Elaine’s
apartment, the restaurant, and along a moonlit pier.

113
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,220
Then, when he and his editor cut the sequence
together, they kept the dialogue linear.

114
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,949
But visually, the film cuts between the three
locations on almost every line, scrambling

115
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:35,860
our sense of time and space.

116
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:40,080
Elaine: That's where Eddie wrote you? In prison?

117
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,600
Wilson: Oh no. No, no, I knew.

118
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,340
Wilson: I knew before hand. Uhhhh...

119
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,560
Wilson: What time was it supposed to have happened?

120
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,140
Wilson: Eddie said... two in the morning.

121
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,820
Wilson: Well, that's like 8 hours difference between here and London.

122
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:01,680
Wilson: That would have made it like about ten o'clock my time.

123
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,540
Wilson: I was just going out in the yard.

124
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,020
The effect is disorienting, and visually confusing.

125
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,069
But the emotions – the yearning, pain, and
regret – are the connective tissue throughout

126
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:12,430
the sequence and play very clearly.

127
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:16,580
To make the scene even more complex, it’s
here that Soderbergh cuts in most of the Poor

128
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,069
Cow footage, as Wilson thinks back to his
early days with Jenny’s mom.

129
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:23,330
It’s a risky technique, one that threatens
to confuse the audience.

130
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:27,490
But used in such an intentional way, it’s
tremendously effective.

131
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,349
An equally creative and effective sequence
plays out at Valentine’s house, high in

132
00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:32,460
the Hollywood Hills.

133
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,990
Wilson and Eduardo crash a cocktail party,
because Wilson wants to see Valentine in the

134
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:37,990
flesh.

135
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,440
After skulking around the house and stealing
a photograph of Jenny, Wilson finds himself

136
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,970
out on the deck, staring back inside at an
oblivious Valentine.

137
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:50,360
Wilson’s staring is intercut with stylized,
slow motion shots of him walking in the house,

138
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,350
pulling his pistol, and shooting Valentine
in the chest.

139
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:58,669
Over these shots we just hear the sound
of crashing waves, a motif that recurs throughout

140
00:07:58,669 --> 00:07:59,800
the film.

141
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,360
These choices make it clear that this is Wilson’s
fantasy, rather than something that’s

142
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:15,379
actually happening.

143
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:18,919
The film then cuts back to Wilson on the deck,
and he starts walking into the house.

144
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:22,440
And again, we cut to shots of Wilson pulling
his pistol, aiming, and firing.

145
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,009
This time, we hear more party noise and the
shots play at regular speed.

146
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:29,340
It feels like we’re getting closer to reality
— but not quite.

147
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,950
And then we cut back to Wilson entering
the house a third time.

148
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:36,789
This time, Soderbergh doesn’t stylize the
shots, and the sounds of the party play at

149
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:37,789
full volume.

150
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,599
So this feels very real.

151
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,159
Wilson pulls his gun, Valentine sees him and
freezes, and Wilson shoots Valentine in the

152
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,159
head.

153
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,790
A woman screams and we cut to…

154
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,260
Valentine, unhurt, as Eduardo stops Wilson
from drawing his pistol.

155
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:55,000
By gradually stripping away the slow motion
and subjective sound design, Soderbergh fools

156
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,170
us into believing that the third time we were
actually seeing Wilson’s revenge.

157
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:04,430
But it was really another example of how filmmaking
techniques put us in Wilson’s head, giving

158
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,970
us access to his imagined experience.

159
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,220
So how does this all work?

160
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,060
What makes the movie hold together, instead
of fracturing into a confusing mess?

161
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:17,080
One idea holds that our minds work by moving
back and forth in time, and in and out of fantasy.

162
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,620
You hear a song on the radio, which reminds
you of a high school dance, which makes you

163
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:24,600
think of that outfit you thought was so cool,
which reminds you that you need to go shopping

164
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,100
this weekend for a new coat, which makes you
imagine that you might bump into a local celebrity…

165
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,100
and so on.

166
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,240
Most films iron out these chains of association,
creating clear and linear stories.

167
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,320
Not The Limey.

168
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,390
Here Soderbergh uses the cinematography, editing,
and sound design to immerse us in a character’s

169
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,390
mind.

170
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,209
His goal is subjectivity, not objectivity.

171
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,149
And it comes full circle in the last scene.

172
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:49,920
We see Wilson back on the airplane, in the
same shots that opened the movie.

173
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,230
But this time we learn that he’s on his
flight back to the UK.

174
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:57,529
Suddenly, all the shots of Wilson on that
plane scattered throughout the movie take

175
00:09:57,529 --> 00:09:58,790
on a new meaning.

176
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,420
They frame the whole film as a string of memories.

177
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,899
He’s sitting on the plane, thinking back
over the people he’s met and the things

178
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:05,899
he’s done.

179
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:09,720
His memory is naturally jumping back and forth,
mixing events, capturing fleeting moments,

180
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,510
and not always making narrative sense.

181
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,389
And the intended meaning of the film becomes
clear:

182
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:18,940
it’s a story about Wilson’s meditation
on regret, redemption, and the inability to

183
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,160
escape the past.

184
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,209
With The Limey, Soderbergh has taken a conventional
revenge plot and used the tools of cinema

185
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:27,870
to elevate it to something richer and more
profound.

186
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:32,670
It’s a unique puzzle of a film that gets
its power less from the story itself, and

187
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,040
more because of how that story is told.

188
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,640
Next time, we’ll find new ways to get at
a character’s subjective experience as we

189
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,660
look at Juliette Binoche’s performance in
Kieślowski's classic film Blue.

190
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,960
Crash Course Film Criticism is produced in association with PBS Digital Studios.
