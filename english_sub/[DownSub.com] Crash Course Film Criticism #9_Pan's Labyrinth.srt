00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,170
From Georges Méliès’s lunar landscape
to the sands of Tatooine, movies have been

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,110
transporting us to different worlds since
the beginning of cinema.

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,660
And a lot of these films use their fantasy
worlds to comment on the real world that we

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:14,660
all live in.

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,060
Avatar can be read as a plea to protect the
natural world, while The Hunger Games takes

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,430
reality TV and income inequality to their
brutal extremes.

7
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:26,350
And in 2006, a movie took on authoritarianism
and the violent aftershocks of the Spanish

8
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:31,410
Civil War—all through the eyes of an innocent
young girl and the fairy tale world she discovers

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,409
in the woods.

10
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:36,631
Filled with original imagery and drawing on
folklore and fantasy traditions, Pan’s Labyrinth

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,600
takes us on a journey to a place as violent
and cruel as it is beautiful and compassionate.

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:53,840
[Intro Music Plays]

13
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,790
Acclaimed Mexican writer-director Guillermo

14
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,430
del Toro was already an established filmmaker
by the time he released Pan’s Labyrinth

15
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,430
in 2006.

16
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:04,438
From the gothic horror of Cronos and The Devil’s
Backbone, to the sly humor of his comic book

17
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:07,350
adaptation Hellboy, del Toro had built a reputation.

18
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,689
He’s known for embedding rich, sympathetic
characters—especially children and otherworldly

19
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:13,869
creatures—in larger than life stories.

20
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:17,539
With Pan’s Labyrinth, he set out to combine
both these impulses to create a story that

21
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:20,549
was half fantasy adventure, half historical
political drama.

22
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:25,409
Set in 1944 just after the Spanish Civil War,
the film follows Ofelia, played with wonder

23
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:27,399
and grit by Ivana Baquero.

24
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:31,409
She’s a young girl traveling with her pregnant
mother to join her stepfather in the Spanish

25
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:32,409
countryside.

26
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:36,040
The forces of fascist dictator Francisco Franco
have an outpost there, from which they hope

27
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,299
to exterminate the rest of the anti-fascist
rebels hiding in the hills.

28
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,549
And Ofelia’s stepfather, Captain Vidal,
is the commander of this outpost.

29
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:44,820
He’s also fascism personified.

30
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,999
Grimly portrayed by Sergi López, Vidal demands
absolute loyalty and sees mercy as a sign

31
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:50,999
of weakness.

32
00:01:50,999 --> 00:01:54,659
He won’t hesitate to torture or kill anyone
who even might be a threat to the new Spanish

33
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:55,659
government.

34
00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:59,619
Now, the film opens with an unnamed narrator
telling the story of Princess Moanna, the

35
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,529
long lost daughter of the King of Underworld.

36
00:02:01,529 --> 00:02:05,259
And Ofelia is a voracious reader, especially
of fairy tales.

37
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:08,989
So whether that story is coming from her
imagination or her books, or is the actual

38
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:11,379
truth of the film is hard to pin down at first.

39
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:15,170
But the movie does suggest there’s more
to Ofelia’s story than meets the eye.

40
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:19,599
She escapes Vidal’s outpost and discovers
a fantasy world in an ancient stone labyrinth

41
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,280
hidden in the nearby woods.

42
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,280
There she meets a faun, as menacing as he
is magical, who tells Ofelia that she may

43
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,680
be the long lost Princess Moanna.

44
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,629
And she has to complete three tasks to claim
her birthright.

45
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:34,830
The action of the film then moves back and
forth between these two worlds.

46
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,909
In one, Ofelia’s mother Carmen, played by
Ariadna Gil, fights illness as her due

47
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:39,909
date nears.

48
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:43,659
Meanwhile, Vidal hunts the rebels, and Vidal’s
housekeeper Mercedes embarks on a dangerous

49
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:44,700
mission to aid them.

50
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,959
And in the fantasy realm, Ofelia gets a key
from the belly of a giant toad, reclaims a

51
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,750
dagger from a child-eating monster called
the Pale Man, and finally – after her mother

52
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,810
dies in childbirth and the rebels storm the
outpost – she steals her baby half-brother

53
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,019
and brings him to the center of the labyrinth.

54
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:04,379
There, Ofelia is confronted with a final choice,
to give the baby to the faun as a sacrifice

55
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:06,549
or return him to the villainous Vidal.

56
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:11,349
In the ultimate selfless act, Ofelia refuses
them both, protecting her half-brother’s

57
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:12,530
life with her own.

58
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:17,249
Vidal grabs the child and – spoiler alert
– shoots Ofelia, leaving her for dead.

59
00:03:17,249 --> 00:03:21,670
As her blood drips down into the labyrinth,
Ofelia is magically transported to a golden

60
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,900
throne room.

61
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:28,200
She finds herself healed, dressed in beautiful
clothes, and wearing… not quite Ruby Slippers,

62
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,409
but definitely red shoes.

63
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:34,439
Her mother and father sit on two impossibly
tall thrones, with a third seat for her.

64
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:36,170
Her family is reunited.

65
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:40,260
And while we see Ofelia die in the real world,
the closing narration tells us that she reigned

66
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,579
for centuries in the Underworld, that she
was beloved by her people, and that traces

67
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:46,889
of her can still be found if you know where
to look.

68
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:51,640
The film ends on the image of a flower opening
on a branch Ofelia had once touched, suggesting

69
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,640
just that.

70
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,129
Pan’s Labyrinth is a film of strong contradictions,
as beautiful as it is bloody.

71
00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:01,409
It’s a fairy tale about a child, but also
a violent, R-rated film clearly made for adults.

72
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:05,069
Our job as film critics is to reconcile these
contradictions as we construct our reading

73
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:06,069
of the movie.

74
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:09,209
One way to look at Pan’s Labyrinth is to
consider it through the lens of folklore.

75
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:13,200
Scholars have long suggested that fairy tales
give children a framework to understanding

76
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,170
the sometimes arbitrary and brutal world of
adults.

77
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:20,029
In this reading, the fantasy world operates
as Ofelia’s way to interpret the real world.

78
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:24,250
I mean, think about it: here’s a young girl,
dumped onto the front lines of a violent conflict,

79
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,780
perpetrated by this scary man she’s expected
to call “Father.”

80
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,110
And on top of it all, her mother’s in real
danger.

81
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,650
The only way for Ofelia’s mind to cope is
to create a fantasy world through which she

82
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,650
can explore and understand what’s actually
happening to her.

83
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,090
And what’s actually happening is downright
disgusting.

84
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:43,650
del Toro rarely pulls the camera away from
violence, forcing us to confront Vidal’s

85
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:48,099
homicidal wrath as he smashes a man’s face
with a wine bottle, prepares to torture a

86
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:50,220
rebel, or shoots half a dozen people in cold
blood.

87
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,780
Ofelia doesn’t necessarily witness all of
these attacks.

88
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:57,080
But Vidal’s menace and sadism is so intense
that the film suggests that Ofelia lives in

89
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,389
terror in his house.

90
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:02,830
Which is exactly why Ofelia has invented
the fairy tale half of the film.

91
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,000
American scholar and fairy tale expert Jack
Zipes writes in the Journal

92
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,270
of American Folklore: “[Ofelia] wills
herself into this tale … and creates it

93
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:14,169
so that she can deal with forces (her mother,
Vidal, the end of the Civil War) impinging

94
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:15,300
on her life.

95
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,580
What happens in the fairy tale is what provides
her with the courage to oppose the real cruelty

96
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,670
of monstrous people.”

97
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:25,360
Seen this way, when Ofelia outsmarts the giant
toad and extracts the key or uses her ingenuity

98
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,290
to outwit and outrun the Pale Man, she’s
actually figuring out how to stand up to the

99
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,740
adults in her life who are ill-equipped or
not willing to protect her.

100
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,430
del Toro’s genius is to go back past the
sanitized Disney version of fairy tales to

101
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,960
their more barbaric origins.

102
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,620
In Pan’s Labyrinth, the fantasy world seems
as merciless as the real one.

103
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,770
The toad is nearly as big as Ofelia and seems
like it could eat her.

104
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:49,039
The Pale Man bites the heads off two little
fairies in graphic detail.

105
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,960
And the faun clearly plans to sacrifice Ofelia’s
infant half-brother with the dagger she recovered.

106
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,270
So, really, Ofelia doesn’t really escape
the atrocities of fascist Spain, but she learns

107
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,540
to come to terms with them, by refracting
them through the lens of these stories she loves.

108
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,060
Del Toro draws inspiration from a wide range
of tales, novels, and films to build the world

109
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,150
of Pan’s Labyrinth.

110
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,810
Everything from the early stories of Snow
White and Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland,

111
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,750
to The Wizard of Oz and ancient Greek myths.

112
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:18,550
He even draws on the most famous Spanish novel
of all, Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes.

113
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:22,360
That story also follows a protagonist whose
fantastical visions help him cope with the

114
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,380
trials of the real world.

115
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,220
But that’s not the only way to read Pan’s
Labyrinth.

116
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:30,099
Another, more radical, approach suggests that
the fairy tale world might be just as real

117
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:31,810
as the one crawling with fascist soldiers.

118
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:35,190
This reading takes its cues from what Guillermo
del Toro himself has said about the film.

119
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:39,389
Now, since the late 1930s, it’s been out
of fashion to take into account an author’s

120
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:41,360
intent when analyzing a piece of film.

121
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,449
But that doesn’t mean it can’t be useful.

122
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:45,050
Especially if there’s evidence to support
their ideas.

123
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,539
Guillermo del Toro has said the he wanted
to make a film about “authority and disobedience.”

124
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:52,870
And when you look at the film through this
lens, the movie’s contradictions and characters

125
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,880
can be divided up in a different way.

126
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,520
Some characters, like Captain Vidal, his soldiers,
and Carmen, represent authority.

127
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,350
Vidal and his lieutenants issue commands and
enforce order.

128
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:06,699
Carmen obeys, even when it puts her, Ofelia,
or her unborn child at risk.

129
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:08,300
Other characters represent disobedience.

130
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,440
Like, time and again, Ofelia refuses to follow
the rules.

131
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,680
She wanders off on dangerous adventures, gets
her fancy clothes dirty, and nearly dies in

132
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,920
one terrifying sequence when she disobeys
the faun and eats food from the Pale Man’s table.

133
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:24,120
Mercedes disobeys Vidal by sneaking food,
medicine, and information to the rebels.

134
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:28,000
And they’re engaged in the ultimate act
of disobedience: all-out war against the new

135
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
fascist government.

136
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,259
At first, the film seems to break down along
clean lines.

137
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:34,080
Fascism and allegiance to power are bad.

138
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,479
Resistance and hope are good.

139
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:37,949
But where does the faun fit into all this?

140
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:42,210
He’s part of Ofelia’s disruptive fantasy
world, but he also abandons her when she dares

141
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,590
to disobey him.

142
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:47,389
And he only returns when she agrees to do
exactly as he says.

143
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:49,680
In the end, he demands blind loyalty.

144
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,680
Just like Vidal.

145
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,530
Really, Ofelia’s life is more often in danger
in the fantasy world.

146
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:56,659
It’s just as dark and cruel as the world
of Vidal and the rebels.

147
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:58,690
And maybe it’s just as real, too.

148
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:02,800
So what if the fantasy realm is not just a
child’s coping mechanism, but it’s an

149
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,879
actual reality within the world of the film?

150
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,070
The filmmaking techniques del Toro uses seem
to support this view.

151
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,599
In shot after shot, the camera moves fluidly
between the two worlds.

152
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,020
He often uses the trees or walls to hide wipe-cuts
that make it feel like fantasy and reality

153
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,020
are connected.

154
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:20,550
Several times, del Toro even moves back and
forth between the dimensions in uninterrupted

155
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,729
single shots.

156
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:24,620
Which also suggests that they’re both part
of a single reality.

157
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:47,460
Finally, objects from the fairy tale world
sometimes show up in the real world.

158
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:51,280
Things like a special key, a mandrake root,
and a magical piece of chalk all make the

159
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,280
transition.

160
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,600
What first seems to be a film divided cleanly
between fantasy and reality, turns out to

161
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,960
be much more ambiguous.

162
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,080
As the Canadian scholar Jennifer Orme puts it: “This ambiguity is … crucial

163
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,420
to the film’s social critique of the systemic
violence employed by militaristic regimes

164
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:10,750
that wish to create, as Vidal says, a ‘clean’
and decidedly unambiguous world by destroying

165
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:16,040
all that is disobedient—all that does not
fit into the master narrative of totalitarianism.”

166
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,760
Guillermo del Toro refuses to obey contemporary
conventions of fairy tales as clean and safe

167
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,040
stories for children.

168
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,590
He refuses to draw a clear line between the
real and the fantastical.

169
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,280
And he refuses to make one reality clearly
good.

170
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:33,260
By doing all this, del Toro has made a film
that, in itself, is an act of rebellion against

171
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,280
unquestioned authority.

172
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,500
However you choose to look at Pan’s Labyrinth,
the film stands as a remarkable achievement

173
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,420
of narrative and technical mastery.

174
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,960
It’s also a deeply tragic story. Del Toro once said:

175
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,760
Guillermo Del Toro: War is the ultimate act of intolerance.

176
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:54,220
War gives no honor. In my mind, it gives no victory.

177
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:58,620
And there are no winners, only losers.

178
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,360
There's only live victims and dead victims.

179
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,720
And few films drive home that point as elegantly
as Pan’s Labyrinth.

180
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,280
...Or The Devil’s Backbone… you should
watch The Devil’s Backbone too.

181
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,480
Whether you think Ofelia’s escaping into
her imagination, or involved in an actual

182
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,410
quest, the horrors of Franco’s fascist regime
provide the perfect backdrop for this story

183
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:20,630
of innocence as the ultimate hope for the
future.

184
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:25,830
Next time, we’ll follow a British criminal
as he scours LA and his own soul in search

185
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:29,830
of his daughter’s killers in Steven Soderbergh’s revenge thriller The Limey.

186
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:33,880
Crash Course Film Criticism is produced in
