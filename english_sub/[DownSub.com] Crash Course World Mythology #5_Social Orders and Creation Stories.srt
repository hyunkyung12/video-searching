00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,160
Hi I’m Mike Rugnetta, this is Crashcourse
Mythology and today, rather than focus on

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,220
how the earth and what’s around it was created,
we’re going to look specifically at what’s

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:14,610
on it, more specifically people, and even
more specifically, men and women.

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:15,610
People.

5
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:16,610
Also the occasional animal.

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:17,900
No, not you Thoth.

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,310
You’re a god with an animal head, it’s
different.

8
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,300
Anyway, we’re going to see how myths explain
our origins and our relationships with each

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,519
other, or at least how they try to explain
them.

10
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:38,100
It’s couples therapy, myth style.

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,440
INTRO
Myths don’t usually incorporate contemporary

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,920
ideas of gender fluidity, although sometimes
they do--Tireisias, ancient seer, I’m looking

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,920
at you.

14
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,310
As we’ve seen from the Chinese and Zoroastrian
creation stories, myths often tend to focus

15
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:58,540
on dualities, or binaries, and one of the
key ones we find is a distinction between

16
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,270
men and women.

17
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:05,400
And this binary opposition frequently sets
women as subordinate to men, at least on earth.

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,210
In the heavens, it’s a little bit more complicated,
as it tends to be.

19
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,219
Let’s start with a story that is probably
well known to many of our viewers: the creation

20
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:15,619
of man and woman from the Bible.

21
00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:19,320
Close readers of the Book of Genesis will
know that there are two or even three creation

22
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,860
stories in it, which, according to Biblical
scholars reflects different writing traditions.

23
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:27,140
We’re going to focus on the second one,
found in Genesis 2.

24
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:33,220
As we join our story, God has already created
the the earth and the heavens and man to till

25
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,030
the earth, because as we established last
time: Gods don’t like weeding.

26
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:41,869
Unlike the first version of creation in Genesis,
man is created near the very beginning, which

27
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:45,920
suggests that he’s actually pretty important
in the grand scheme of things.

28
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,479
But apparently one man wasn’t enough for
all that Edenic gardening.

29
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,490
Genesis 2 verse 21 begins:
So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall

30
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:01,549
upon the man, and while he slept took one
his ribs and closed up its place with flesh:

31
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:07,079
and with the rib the Lord God had taken from
the man he made into a woman and brought her

32
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,079
to the man.

33
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:09,590
Then the man said,

34
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:15,670
This is the bone of my bones and flesh of
my flesh, she should be called Woman, because

35
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,099
she was taken out of Man.

36
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:23,380
Therefore a man leaves his father and his
mother and cleaves to his wife and they become

37
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,400
one flesh.

38
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,260
Here we see an early justification for men
being superior to women and it’s kind of

39
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,170
based on bad word play.

40
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:34,000
In the rest of the Genesis story, one of the
things that marks man’s dominion over other

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,959
creatures is that he is given the power to
name them, just as he is permitted to name

42
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:38,959
woman here.

43
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,400
The word play here also works in the original
Hebrew, where the word for man is “ish”

44
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,390
and the word for woman is “isha” Get it!

45
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:50,190
She was taken out of man and so even her name
is taken out of man.

46
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,190
Yup.

47
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,190
It’s Hilarious.

48
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,209
Just ask Gelos, Greek god of laughter.

49
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:55,420
Yeah, tough crowd.

50
00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:00,340
This passage also explains marriage -- although
only between a man and a woman -- and describes

51
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,640
a social order in which men leave their parents’
household when they marry to have their own

52
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,640
homes.

53
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,909
Whether this describes a family structure
that already existed or was written in order

54
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:14,670
to encourage such a family structure, we can’t
say for certain, but it’s likely that this

55
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,790
was an after-the-fact description.

56
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:20,680
Providing a rationalization for what people
encounter in their daily lives is an important

57
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,680
function of myths.

58
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,480
The Bible goes on to refine the “natural”
relationship between men and women and not

59
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,140
in an especially fun or feminist way.

60
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,790
After they eat the fruit from the tree of
knowledge, God is miffed and he punishes them.

61
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:38,720
To the woman he said,
I will greatly multiply your pain in childbearing;

62
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,770
In pain you should bring forth children,
Yet your desire shall be for your husband,

63
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:46,280
And he shall rule over you.

64
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,510
And to Adam he said,
Because you have listened to the voice of

65
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,760
your wife,
And you have eaten of the tree of which I

66
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,020
commanded you,
“You shall not eat of it,”

67
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:01,760
cursed is the ground because of you;
in toil you shall eat of it all the days of

68
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,379
your life;
thorns and thistles it shall bring forth to

69
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:08,490
you;
and you shall eat the plants of the field.

70
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:13,249
In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread
Till you return to the ground,

71
00:04:13,249 --> 00:04:17,899
For out of it you were taken;
You are dust, and to dust you shall return.

72
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,659
There’s just a lot going on here.

73
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,950
One way to interpret this is that it provides
justification for man’s dominance over women

74
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:28,289
as a punishment for what one woman did in
disobeying god.

75
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:32,660
The first punishments directly affect the
experiences of women, causing the pain of

76
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:38,389
childbirth and desire for a husband that shall
“rule over” her, establishing a patriarchal

77
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:41,030
order that really caught on.

78
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:45,110
Men are punished too, by having to work hard
in order to eat, toiling at bringing food

79
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,110
out of the ground.

80
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,110
More gardening.

81
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,370
And what is the reward for all this hard work?

82
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,370
Death.

83
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,370
And returning to the ground.

84
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,460
Not even dental benefits.

85
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:58,130
Worse yet, as far as solidifying male-dominance
goes, all of this is because man listened

86
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,390
to the voice of his wife.

87
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,419
So that sets a pretty nasty precedent.

88
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:06,450
Greek mythology creates a similar rationale
for misogyny with the story of Pandora.

89
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:13,389
Even before she opened the jar bringing sorrows
to all the world, Zeus made her as a punishme

90
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:17,180
nt for Prometheus who stole fire and gave
it to the humans.

91
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,660
This is in addition to having his liver eaten
by an eagle for all of eternity.

92
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:27,580
According to Hesiod she would be, “Another
gift to men, an evil thing for their delight.”[1]

93
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:34,380
Hermes endowed Pandora with “lies and persuasive
words and cunning ways.”[2] And probably

94
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,300
also, like, the absolute perfect shade of
lipstick, but before we agree to this image

95
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:44,860
of women as conniving and untrustworthy, let’s
pause to remember that it’s Hermes, a male

96
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:49,950
god and one of the great misogynists of the
ancient world, who bestows these qualities

97
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:54,669
on Pandora, so this is a dude’s hateful
vision of women.

98
00:05:54,669 --> 00:06:00,639
Anyway, Zeus gave Pandora as a gift to Prometheus’s
brother Epimetheus, who accepted her, even

99
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,700
though Prometheus had told him to never accept
a gift from Zeus.

100
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,419
Maybe Zeus gifted lots of socks.

101
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:10,599
According to Hesiod, here’s what happened:
Before this time men lived upon the earth

102
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:16,340
Apart from sorrow and from painful work,
Free from disease, which brings the Death-gods

103
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,340
in.

104
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:23,979
But now the woman opened up the cask,
And scattered pains and evils among men.

105
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:27,090
Inside the cask’s hard walls remained one
thing,

106
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:31,110
Hope, only, which did not fly through the
door.

107
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:38,270
The lid stopped her, but all the others flew,
Thousands of troubles wandering the earth.[3]

108
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,889
Unfortunately, this concept that a social
order of male dominance and female subordination

109
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:48,300
resulting from women acting out of turn, is
not unique to the Biblical or the Greek tradition.

110
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,009
We find a similar story in Japan, just without
an evil serpent or an all powerful death chest.

111
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:54,360
Let’s go to the Thoughtbubble.

112
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,650
1.One Japanese creation myth starts with a
young, not fully formed earth that looks something

113
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:00,650
like a jellyfish.

114
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:06,509
2.Three invisible gods came into existence
in Takamagahara, the High Plains of Heaven.

115
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:13,340
These three gods, called kami, were led by
the Lord of the Center of Heaven, Amanominakanushi-no-kami,

116
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,550
After them were seven more generations of
“heavenly” gods, 3.followed finally by

117
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:21,830
the primal couple Izanagi and his wife Izanami,
who was also his sister.

118
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:26,610
4.Izanagi and Izanami were commanded by the
gods to solidify the drifting land, so they

119
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:31,879
went to the Floating Bridge of Heaven and
stirred the soupy liquid below with a spear.

120
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:37,289
Drops congealed on the tip of the spear, and
formed the island of Onogoro, the first dry

121
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:38,289
land.

122
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:41,510
5.The Primal Couple went down to Onogoro and
built a heavenly pillar.

123
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:45,819
Then they decided to procreate
Izanagi asked his sister how her body was

124
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:50,650
formed and she told him that there was an
unfinished part between her legs.

125
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:55,870
He replied that between his legs was an excess
and perhaps the two should join there.

126
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:00,370
They devised a marriage ritual whereby each
would walk around the pillar, and when they

127
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,310
met they would exchange compliments and have
intercourse.

128
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:08,750
6.A child was born, but it was a deformed
leech-child called Hiruko.

129
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,949
Its parents put Hiruko in a boat and set it
out to sea.

130
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:17,280
The gods determined that the reason that the
first child was born deformed was that Izanami

131
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,569
had spoken first.

132
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:23,360
7.Izanami and Izanagi returned to the heavenly
pillar in Onogoro and repeated the ritual,

133
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,750
only this time Izanagi spoke first.

134
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:32,089
In due time, Izanami gave birth to an abundant
number of children, islands, gods and goddesses.[4]

135
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:33,089
Thank you, Thoughtbubble.

136
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:38,089
This rationale established male precedence
and female subservience in Japan.

137
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:42,849
Not only does this myth explain Japanese gender
inequality, it also may explain an ancient

138
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:48,769
Japanese ritual in which the birth of a first
child was celebrated by putting a clay figurine

139
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:53,240
into a reed boat and floating it away.[5]
There is often a strong connection between

140
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,790
myths and rituals.

141
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:59,320
Many creation stories begin with the idea
that human beings are immortal until something

142
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,640
or someone intrudes.

143
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,279
Biblical humans were immortal until Adam and
Eve ate from the tree of knowledge, for example.

144
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:11,440
It was human error that brought death into
the world.

145
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,960
Oops.

146
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,470
So we see another theme emerging here.

147
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:22,700
The Biblical, Japanese, and Greek explanations
place the blame for human toil, pain, disease

148
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,700
on women.

149
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:29,930
It’s a pernicious idea, and it’s one that
has had profound consequences for gender relations.

150
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,589
Perhaps what we are seeing is a justification
for a system in which men feel it is their

151
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:39,000
right to rule over women, and find stories
to tell to support it.

152
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,070
After all, there is no logical reason why
women should be blamed.

153
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,070
Men make mistakes, too.

154
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:50,730
We’re gonna get to Phaeton, and that time
he almost burned down the entire Earth, eventually.

155
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,860
Thanks for watching, see you next time.

156
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,950
Crash Course Mythology is filmed in the Chad
and Stacy Emigholz Studio in Indianapolis,

157
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:00,950
Indiana, and was made with the help of all
these nice people.
