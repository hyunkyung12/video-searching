00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,947
Hi! I'm Mike, this is Crash Course Mythology and today,

2
00:00:03,947 --> 00:00:09,937
we're going to talk about something that's almost impossible to avoid when discussing creation myths: Sex.

3
00:00:09,937 --> 00:00:14,850
Or, more specifically, sexual reproduction. It's going to be a little awkward.

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,720
Stop covering your ears Thot, you're gonna be fine!
You can handle it. We can all handle it.

5
00:00:19,723 --> 00:00:24,035
We're all adults and after all, sexual reproduction is how all of us got to be here!

6
00:00:24,035 --> 00:00:27,746
Well, maybe not Thot who was born of Seth's skull? Ew.

7
00:00:27,746 --> 00:00:34,760
But for the rest of us, it probably makes sense that a lot of cosmic creation myths often invoke sexual reproduction.

8
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:41,280
Still, cosmic sexual reproduction is a little different, and sometimes a lot weirder than human sexual reproduction.

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,642
Well, I mean– depending on what you're into of course.

10
00:00:43,642 --> 00:00:52,725
[Theme Music]

11
00:00:52,735 --> 00:00:58,026
So let's ease into this with a little latin.
Sexy, sexy latin.

12
00:00:58,026 --> 00:01:04,417
So, you know how when you grow plants, they come from seeds? Well in latin, the word for "seed" is "semen."

13
00:01:04,417 --> 00:01:08,794
Which is why a man's seminal fluid is also sometimes called his seed.

14
00:01:08,794 --> 00:01:13,272
The idea of something growing from a seed is a logical analogy to creation but,

15
00:01:13,272 --> 00:01:18,322
multiple godly fluids seem to be fertile, as we'll see in an Egyptian creation myth.

16
00:01:18,322 --> 00:01:22,362
In one of the many versions of the Egyptian creation story, the creator god says:

17
00:01:22,364 --> 00:01:30,114
"I fulfilled all my desires when I was alone, before had appeared a second to be with me in this place;

18
00:01:30,114 --> 00:01:38,684
I assumed form as that great soul wherein I started being creative while still in the primeval waters in a state of inertness...

19
00:01:38,684 --> 00:01:43,164
so it was I who spat forth Shu and expectorated Tefnut..."

20
00:01:43,164 --> 00:01:52,100
So, honestly, that sounds a lot more like saliva. At least in translation. But the image becomes clearer in a later part of the myth, when the god relates:

21
00:01:52,100 --> 00:02:00,900
"When I rubbed with my fist my heart came into my mouth in that I spat forth Shu and expectorated Tefnut."

22
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:08,963
Thankfully this myth isn't actually... explicit, in what the gods are doing, and the... anatomy is obviously a little strange,

23
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:15,263
but here's a god, alone, fulfilling his desires, and rubbing with his fist.

24
00:02:15,263 --> 00:02:19,075
With the result that two new figures–also gods–are created.

25
00:02:19,075 --> 00:02:23,455
It's not Shakespeare-level body, but neither is it Disney Channel material, right?

26
00:02:23,455 --> 00:02:27,978
Notice that the creator god here is alone, and also presumably male.

27
00:02:27,978 --> 00:02:33,038
This may suggest a patrilineal culture since creation occurs without a female presence.

28
00:02:33,038 --> 00:02:38,499
The story of Mbombo's creation, from the Boshongo Bantu people in Africa, is remarkably similar.

29
00:02:38,499 --> 00:02:46,227
Including water, a solitary creator, and best of all, vomiting.
It's a banner day for bodily fluids here at Crash Course.

30
00:02:46,227 --> 00:02:51,017
In the beginning, in the dark, there was nothing but water, and Mbombo was alone.

31
00:02:51,017 --> 00:02:58,137
One day Mbombo was in terrible pain.
He retched and strained and vomited up the sun.

32
00:02:58,137 --> 00:03:06,247
After that, light spread over everything. The heat of the sun dried up the water until the black edges of the world began to show.

33
00:03:06,247 --> 00:03:11,377
Black sandbanks and reefs could be seen. But there were no living things.

34
00:03:11,377 --> 00:03:17,737
Mbombo vomited up the moon, and then the stars, and after that the night had its light also.

35
00:03:17,737 --> 00:03:26,834
Still, Mbombo was in pain. He strained again and nine living creatures came forth. Last of all, came man.

36
00:03:26,834 --> 00:03:34,901
Again, we have a solitary man creating the world using his body and bringing it forth after being in terrible pain.

37
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:37,611
Which is possibly an analog to female childbirth.

38
00:03:37,611 --> 00:03:46,645
And speaking of pain, few myths involve more of it than the Greek creation story involving Aphrodite. I mean this myth just has it all.

39
00:03:46,645 --> 00:03:52,715
Water, genitals, violence, creation, armored giants– really just the whole completely horrifying megillah.

40
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:55,129
Here's the version found in Hesoid's Theogyny.

41
00:03:55,129 --> 00:04:04,988
"Great Heaven came, bring on the night and desirous of love, he spread himself over the Earth, stretched out in every direction.

42
00:04:04,988 --> 00:04:14,742
His son Chronos reached out from the ambush with his left hand, with his right he took a huge sickle with its long row of sharp teeth, and quickly,

43
00:04:14,742 --> 00:04:20,341
cut off his father's genitals, and flung them behind him to fly where they might.

44
00:04:20,341 --> 00:04:33,761
They were not released from his hand to no effect: for all the drops of blood that flew off were received by the Earth, and as the years went round, she bore the powerful Erinyes,

45
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:43,271
and the great Giants in gleaming armor with long spears in their hands, and the nymphs whom they called Meliai on the boundless earth.

46
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:51,971
As for the genitals, just as he first cut them off with his instrument of adamant, and threw them from the land into the surging sea,

47
00:04:51,971 --> 00:05:02,761
even so they were carried on the wave for a long time. About them a white foam grew from the immortal flesh and in it, a girl formed.

48
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:08,721
First she approached holy Cythera, and then from there she came to sea-girt Cyprus.

49
00:05:08,721 --> 00:05:16,231
And out stepped a modest and beautiful goddess, and the grass began to grow all round beneath her slender feet.

50
00:05:16,231 --> 00:05:24,031
Gods and men call her Aphrodite, because she was formed in foam, and Cytherea, because she approached Cythera,

51
00:05:24,031 --> 00:05:32,888
and Cyprus-born because she was born in wave-washed Cyrpus, and 'genial', because she appeared out of genitals."

52
00:05:32,888 --> 00:05:35,878
Side-note: I need to stop using the word genial as an adjective.

53
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:42,720
And there you have it ladies and gentlemen, violent castration begets a word meaning "friendly" or "cheerful", and the goddess of love.

54
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,340
Well, one goddess of love. There are lots of others, and we'll see more of them in later episodes on pantheons.

55
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:53,445
But enough about saliva and vomit and bleeding testicles and other horrifying things that can potentially be read as semen,

56
00:05:53,445 --> 00:05:57,685
let's turn to that other important part of sexual reproduction: the egg.

57
00:05:57,687 --> 00:06:01,642
A number of cultures have creation myths that feature something called a cosmic egg.

58
00:06:01,642 --> 00:06:11,721
In one Indian creation myth, found in the Satapatha Brahmana, the creator god, in this story called Prajapati, forms a cosmic egg after creating water.

59
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:19,827
Out of which this egg come various creatures, but most importantly, the Earth and the rest of the universe, which, confusingly, is also water.

60
00:06:19,827 --> 00:06:22,154
One translation from the 19th century puts it this way:

61
00:06:22,162 --> 00:06:32,933
"He desired, 'May I be reproduced from these waters!' He entered the waters with that triple science. Thence an egg arose. He touched it.

62
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:39,463
'Let it exist! let it exist and multiply!' so he said. From it the Brahman was first created."

63
00:06:39,463 --> 00:06:45,444
"And that which was the shell became the earth. [...] The juice which flowed from it became a tortoise [...]

64
00:06:45,444 --> 00:06:54,275
This whole (earth) dissolved itself all over the water: all this (universe) appeared as one form only, namely, water."

65
00:06:54,275 --> 00:07:02,825
So that is... confusing. And also... wet.
Also, what is this triple science that he enters the waters with?

66
00:07:02,825 --> 00:07:11,506
What we do understand is that, water brings forth an egg. And from that egg comes the Earth, sky, a tortoise, and more water.

67
00:07:11,506 --> 00:07:19,005
There's an early Persian creation story that's similar to the one from India, in that it also has an egg. And hey, our old friend water is here too!

68
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:26,288
According to this story, the god of good, Ahura Mazda, and let's remember, this is a god, not a making model of car, [sarcastic laugh]

69
00:07:26,288 --> 00:07:31,908
Ahura Mazda created a perfect spiritual world, before creating the tangible one.

70
00:07:31,908 --> 00:07:40,348
And this perfect world made the god of evil, Angra Mainyu a.k.a. Ahriman, so angry, that he burst through the cosmic egg,

71
00:07:40,351 --> 00:07:49,918
causing such a disturbance that the sun began to rotate through the sky instead of standing still. And this in turn led to day, night, mountains, valleys,

72
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:57,497
and most importantly, the destruction of the perfect world. Which led to work, pain, and death for humanity. So, nice going evil.

73
00:07:57,497 --> 00:08:01,737
You know what they say: you can't create the universe without breaking a few cosmic eggs.

74
00:08:01,737 --> 00:08:07,417
What, too soon? And why are there no creation myths about cosmic bacon?
I could really go for a cosmic breakfast.

75
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:13,087
There's one more cosmic egg creation myth that I want to talk about, and it follows really nicely from the Zoroastrian one

76
00:08:13,087 --> 00:08:21,476
about Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu because, like that one, it features a duality as a fundamental principle of creation.

77
00:08:21,476 --> 00:08:29,112
One of the many Chinese creation myths combines a cosmic egg trope with a world-parent myth. Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

78
00:08:29,112 --> 00:08:40,078
In the beginning was a huge egg containing Chaos, a mixture of yin-yang—female-male, passive-active, cold-heat, dark-light, and wet-dry.

79
00:08:40,078 --> 00:08:44,867
Within this yin-yang was Phan Ku, that which was not yet anything

80
00:08:44,867 --> 00:08:54,677
but which broke forth from the egg as the giant who separated chaos into the many opposites, including earth and sky.

81
00:08:54,677 --> 00:09:00,978
Phan Ku was covered with hair; horns sprang from his head and tusks from his mouth.

82
00:09:00,978 --> 00:09:08,798
With a great chisel and a huge mallet, he carved out the mountains, valleys, rivers, and oceans.

83
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:13,959
He also made the sun, moon, and stars. He taught the people what they know.

84
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:21,592
When Phan Ku finally died, his skull became the top of the sky, his breath the wind, his voice the thunder,

85
00:09:21,592 --> 00:09:29,122
his legs and arms the four directions, his flesh the soil, his blood the rivers, and so forth.

86
00:09:29,122 --> 00:09:39,387
The people say that the fleas in his hair became human beings. Everything that is, is Phan Ku. And everything that Phan Ku is is yin-yang.

87
00:09:39,387 --> 00:09:45,871
With Phan Ku's death a vacuum was created, and within this vacuum pain and sin were able to flourish.

88
00:09:45,871 --> 00:09:50,863
In the beginning was Chaos, from which light became the sky and darkness formed the Earth.

89
00:09:50,863 --> 00:09:57,751
Yang and yin are contained in light and darkness, and everything is made of these principles.

90
00:09:57,751 --> 00:09:58,623
Thanks Thought Bubble!

91
00:09:58,623 --> 00:10:03,004
Here we see that many of the themes in creation myths overlap.

92
00:10:03,004 --> 00:10:08,152
For example, last week we talked about Chaos, as being a state of undifferentiation,

93
00:10:08,152 --> 00:10:14,142
and here it appears again, although, this time, it's a series of dualities. Mixture of yin-yang.

94
00:10:14,142 --> 00:10:20,484
Unlike in the Bible, where God has to come in and created the dualities as a way of imposing order.

95
00:10:20,484 --> 00:10:26,504
Although this myth features a cosmic egg, it's also an example of what are sometimes called world-parent myths.

96
00:10:26,504 --> 00:10:33,366
"where a creator god brings the universe into being, through actual or metaphorical sexual reproduction,

97
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:38,816
or as in this case, by being differentiated into aspects of the known world."

98
00:10:38,816 --> 00:10:44,634
Those of you who remember Crash Course World History Episode #6 on Vedic religions, Buddhism and Ashoka,

99
00:10:44,634 --> 00:10:50,793
might recall the story of Purusha, who was also divided up into aspects of human reality.

100
00:10:50,793 --> 00:10:58,915
Although Phan Ku and Purusha are usually thought of as male, if they are thought of as having a gender at all, often the world-parent is portrayed as maternal.

101
00:10:58,915 --> 00:11:04,155
An Earth-mother, as opposed to a sky-father.
But that is a story for another day.

102
00:11:04,155 --> 00:11:10,876
So that is out first take on creation stories that involve either explicitly or more symbolically, sexual reproduction.

103
00:11:10,876 --> 00:11:16,768
As you can tell, these myths are not always straightforward, or biologically possible, strictly speaking.

104
00:11:16,768 --> 00:11:22,727
I also hope you haven't come away thinking we're reading too much into these myths. And that we have dirty minds.

105
00:11:22,727 --> 00:11:27,266
Which is what Thot over here thinks.
I'm not the dirty bird, you're the dirty bird.

106
00:11:27,266 --> 00:11:31,676
But that the exciting thing about myths, they're open to various interpretations.

107
00:11:31,676 --> 00:11:39,227
Try your own reading while still noticing the broad commonalities in these stories, taken from many different parts of the world.

108
00:11:39,227 --> 00:11:41,997
And thanks for watching.
We'll see you next week.

109
00:11:41,997 --> 00:11:47,107
