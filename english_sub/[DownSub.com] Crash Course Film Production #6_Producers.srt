1
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:07,132
No movie in the entire history of film has
been made without a producer, whether or not

2
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:08,210
they were credited as one.

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,420
But no one ever seems to know what they do.

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,049
To be fair, it’s a little confusing.

5
00:00:12,049 --> 00:00:15,640
There are different kinds of producers, and
people earn the title of producer for different reasons.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,720
But the job is really hard work.

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,740
They’re the driving force of a movie: getting
a film crew off the ground, keeping everything

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,150
running, and making sure it gets shared with
the world.

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,690
If a film doesn’t get finished... well,
chances are, it could’ve used a team of producers.

00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:42,000
[Intro Music Plays]

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,760
Let’s start with a wide lens and then zoom in.

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,560
See what I did there? Film jokes!

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,340
An executive producer, or EP, oversees the
whole filmmaking process and other producers

14
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,360
involved in the project.

15
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,059
This person might be independent and run a
small studio, like with Crash Course.

16
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:01,000
Or they might work for a larger company, and
represent the studio or the money person – the financier.

17
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:05,239
An executive producer ensures a film has the
funding it requires, and usually sets the

18
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,960
budget and overall schedule.

19
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,960
They can be deeply influential on the style
of the film, too.

20
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,720
Think of movies that were executive produced
by Steven Spielberg.

21
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,020
Or Judd Apatow.

22
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,020
Or Tina Fey.

23
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,990
They’re all different from each other, but
distinct to their EP.

24
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,700
While the job can be highly demanding, sometimes
people are honored with the title because

25
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,920
they’re lending their well-known names to
a production they believe in.

26
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,580
These honorary executive producers might not
be involved in the daily grind, but they’re

27
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,460
very important in helping it get made.

28
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,560
If you have student loans, you’ll understand
when I say that an honorary EP can be like

29
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,700
a really wonderful co-signer.

30
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,440
They’re standing behind your project and
promising to the world that you’re going

31
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,590
to deliver a film that’s up to their standards.

32
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,510
Even when a film has honorary EPs, it’ll
still have an executive producer who’s keeping

33
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:48,299
things running on a macro scale and looking
towards the future: a movie they can sell

34
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:49,390
and get to an audience.

35
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:53,330
Now, an EP is one kind of producer, and
there are lots of different producer roles

36
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,330
that we’ll get to soon.

37
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:58,350
But the simple title of “producer” is
usually where the job description seems the

38
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,600
most... nebulous.

39
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,670
Like, “what-the-heck-do-they-do” kind
of nebulous.

40
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:05,140
Turns out, there’s no one thing that a producer
is or does.

41
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,449
Really, the title can be given to anyone
who was essential in making sure the film

42
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:09,449
got made.

43
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:10,669
This could mean they found funding and resources.

44
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:13,510
Or maybe they developed the idea, balancing
big picture stuff.

45
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,530
Or they might have brought the creative team
together, and hammered out the details that

46
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,650
make a film set run well.

47
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,800
So things can get a little confusing when
you’re reading the credits of a film.

48
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,280
But, not to worry, there’s a code that we
can decipher.

49
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,660
The person who we think of as THE producer will be listed in the credits after the phrase

50
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,660
“produced by”.

51
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,739
This is the person, or sometimes couple
of people, with the seemingly never-ending

52
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:32,760
list of responsibilities.

53
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,170
They’re the point of contact through every
stage of the film, and ultimately responsible

54
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,321
for the movie becoming a movie at all.

55
00:02:38,321 --> 00:02:42,350
In pre-production, the producer finds a project
and develops it with a writer.

56
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,060
Then, they gather the resources and hire the
key crew members for production.

57
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,820
During production, they oversee filming, and
help run the shoot.

58
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,520
And in post-production, the producer works
with the director, editor, and composer to

59
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,720
finish the film.

60
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,390
They can even have the editor cut scenes or
schedule reshoots – if that’s what the

61
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,390
film needs to come together.

62
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:02,960
Their ultimate goal is to crystallize the
vision of the filmmaker and find a way to sell it.

63
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,500
To be clear... not in a skeezy way.

64
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,629
Filmmaking is really expensive.

65
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:10,780
So financiers will pay for a movie up front,
and you want to pay them back for their investment.

66
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,320
Plus, selling the film to distributors is
the only way to get all your hard work out

67
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,320
into the world.

68
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,440
And it’s not really a movie until an audience
sees it.

69
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,300
So, okay.

70
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,740
Now that we have a handle on producers, what
in the world is a co-producer?

71
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,629
This title is actually great, because it’s
descriptive!

72
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:26,920
A co-producer is part of a producing team.

73
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,129
Two or more co-producers will produce a film
as a unit.

74
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:32,349
Sometimes, a co-producer will have another
role in the film.

75
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:35,680
Like, maybe they’re also a writer or an
actor, so they’re not involved in all the

76
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,930
producing responsibilities.

77
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,770
An assistant or associate producer works under
the head honcho producer.

78
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:44,430
On a large production, the producer delegates
work to one or more of them.

79
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,209
Associate producer, like executive producer,
can also be an honorary title given to someone

80
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:52,200
who helped get the film made, like because
they lent their name to the project, or funded it.

81
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,080
Now, let’s talk about specific producer
titles and their duties.

82
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,489
The line producer reports to the producer.

83
00:03:57,489 --> 00:03:59,819
And all the department heads report to the
line producer.

84
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:04,299
The line producer plans and orchestrates the
logistics of the entire production, including

85
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:06,750
scheduling, staffing, and managing how the
budget is used.

86
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,260
Does this sound kind of familiar?

87
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,940
On lower-budget films, the line producer and
the unit production manager might be the same person.

88
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,391
But if they’re not, the line producer plans
all the budgets and other minutia, while the

89
00:04:15,391 --> 00:04:17,599
UPM carries out the line producer’s plans.

90
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:21,119
Sometimes, usually on a TV show or a series
like Crash Course, you’ll see the title

91
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,249
supervising producer, or senior producer.

92
00:04:23,249 --> 00:04:28,099
They help guide the whole project both logistically
and creatively, and report directly to the

93
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:29,099
executive producer.

94
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:33,210
So, now that we’ve got the basic scoop on
what producers do, here’s a puzzle for you.

95
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,919
And, honestly, for the Academy of Arts and
Sciences too.

96
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,840
Who accepts the Oscar for best picture?

97
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,440
See, the director is often thought of as “the
filmmaker,” but they’ve got their own

98
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,789
category: best director.

99
00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:44,939
So the winner of best picture is the producers!

100
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:48,369
They’re usually the ones who chose to make this particular movie and who hired all

101
00:04:48,369 --> 00:04:49,379
the creative leads.

102
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:51,439
So, they deserve some recognition too.

103
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:55,740
Sometimes you’ll see a director or writer
run up on stage to accept the Oscar, because

104
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,819
they were also producer.

105
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:00,369
And there are a lot of reasons why someone
would want to wear so many hats, even though

106
00:05:00,369 --> 00:05:01,379
it’s difficult work.

107
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:02,569
One is control.

108
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:06,370
What we think of as the creative roles – like
writer, director, or even actor – ultimately

109
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,629
answer to the producers.

110
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:10,870
So if you’re one of those producers, you
have more control over the film.

111
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,050
This can mean creative control, because you’re
helping move the film through production.

112
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:17,849
Or it might mean financial or marketing control,
because producers typically help decide what

113
00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:20,089
festivals and audiences the film will reach.

114
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:23,819
Secondly, if someone has proven themselves
to be multi-talented, studios will sometimes

115
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:26,030
prefer to pay one person to do multiple jobs.

116
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,879
Because, remember, filmmaking is expensive!

117
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:33,289
A lot of the time, director/producers or writer/director/producers
are highly experienced auteurs who have the

118
00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:35,050
best understanding of a project.

119
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,199
So if they wear multiple hats, it can really
help the movie’s success.

120
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:41,699
That said, it’s extremely rare for there
to be just one producer on a project.

121
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:45,610
There’s still THE producer with the “produced
by” credit, and the line producer organizing

122
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:49,479
the production, not to mention any other producers
and executive producers on the team.

123
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:52,939
That way, if the director-producer needs to
focus their whole attention on directing

124
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:54,509
at some point, they can!

125
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:55,659
And the production will go on.

126
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:59,520
Oddly enough though, the producing team
doesn’t really seem to scale like other departments.

127
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,849
Like, a couple episodes ago we had a note
comparing the scale of two movies starring

128
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:05,169
Felicity Jones, Rogue One and Like Crazy.

129
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:08,899
Across the board, there were a lot more people
and departments working on Rogue One.

130
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:14,110
For instance, the art department for Rogue
One included 174 credits, while Like Crazy’s

131
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,259
was just 4 people.

132
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:17,319
But that wasn’t true for producers.

133
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:20,759
Rogue One credited 10 producers, while Like
Crazy credited 13.

134
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:24,940
So, how does a movie with a much smaller crew
and budget justify having three more producers

135
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,149
than one with a massive team and 800 times
the budget?

136
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:32,179
Well, there are a couple possibilities.For
one, a filmmaker can need an army, but you

137
00:06:32,179 --> 00:06:35,149
can also make a movie with a small group of
multi-talented people.

138
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:38,779
While anyone on a film set is most likely
going to be a hard worker, on a low-budget

139
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:42,810
film you end up relying on a few heroes who
really go above and beyond.

140
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,990
Often, those people are thanked with a producer
credit of some kind.

141
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,659
Another option is that sometimes people who
usually fill a different role on film projects,

142
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,439
like a makeup artist or sound mixer, want
to get into producing.

143
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:55,539
And they’d do that by starting out small,
and producing a low-budget film.

144
00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:59,629
Third of all, independent films usually benefit
most from an honorary executive producer lending

145
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:00,629
their clout.

146
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,110
So, more producers might be credited for name
recognition reasons.

147
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,550
Fourthly, it’s a good way to stretch your
budget.

148
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,179
Like, if you can’t afford a lead actor’s
salary, you might ask them to be a producer

149
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,080
too, so the project will be worth their while.

150
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,849
They’ll have another credit on their resume,
a foot in the door to a new job in the industry,

151
00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:17,139
plus more control over the film.

152
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:20,669
Any of these reasons could be why a small,
independent film such as Like Crazy would

153
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:22,270
have more producers than Rogue One.

154
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,699
But, after looking a little closer at their
credits, here’s a different guess.

155
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:29,909
You see, one of THE producers – one of the
people Rogue One was produced by –

156
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:30,909
was Kathleen Kennedy.

157
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:35,360
She’s a very, very experienced producer
and has led Lucasfilm since 2012.

158
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,809
Think of some of the biggest blockbusters from the last 35 years, chances are Kathleen Kennedy was

159
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:40,809
a producer on it.

160
00:07:40,809 --> 00:07:41,900
Jurassic Park?

161
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,900
Yep.

162
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,900
Back to the Future?

163
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,900
Yep.

164
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,900
Who Framed Roger Rabbit?

165
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,900
The Sixth Sense?

166
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,900
Indiana Jones?

167
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,800
Yep, yep, yep.

168
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,599
And that goes to show how critical good producers
are to the success of a film.

169
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:55,930
Even though it might be a little confusing
what they do, because they do so many things,

170
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,989
it’s all incredibly important work.

171
00:07:57,989 --> 00:08:01,580
Today we learned about lots of ways a person
can earn the title of producer.

172
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,300
We broke down some different roles, from executive
producers to line producers, and talked about

173
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,110
how they each help a film get made.

174
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:11,240
And next time we’ll talk about the person
who most influences what a film will be:

175
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,240
the director.

176
00:08:12,249 --> 00:08:15,669
Crash Course Film Production is produced in
association with PBS Digital Studios.

177
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:19,490
You can head over to their channel to check
out a playlist of their latest amazing shows,

178
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,399

PBS Space Time.

179
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:27,719
This episode of Crash Course was filmed in
the Doctor Cheryl C. Kinney Crash Course Studio

180
00:08:27,720 --> 00:00:00,000
