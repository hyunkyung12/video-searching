00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,389
Hi, I'm Mike Rugnetta. This is crash course Mythology and today

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:09,598
It's everybody back in the pool... or river... or storm drain overflow from Divine Rainstorms. That's right

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,859
It's our final flood episode and we're heading West to the Americas. Surf's up Thoth

4
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:30,460
We've already talked about floods from the ancient near east at the point between Europe, Africa, and Asia and last week we covered the floods

5
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:35,260
of China in East Asia, but it turns out that essentially anywhere there's a civilization

6
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,809
there's a story of that civilization being destroyed...

7
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,120
by water. One myth from the Inca Empire

8
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:47,440
should sound familiar at this point. Viracocha was the supreme god of the Incas and considered the father of the other gods and

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,200
creator of the World. Viracocha

10
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:57,880
eventually became tired of the race of giants he created to populate the earth. He thought they were lazy and bad-tempered

11
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:02,829
And they always forgot his birthday, so I bet you can guess how he decided to get rid of those forgetful

12
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:07,629
Behemoths. That's right, a flood. Viracocha's flood rose up even higher

13
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:14,290
than the Andes Mountains high enough to drown the giants and in some versions all of humanity along with...

14
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:19,330
A single lucky couple survived by floating in a box. The box drifted to

15
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:23,319
Tiahuanaco. When it came to rest Viracocha made a new people with the

16
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:29,499
surviving couple. As a reminder of the flood we have lake Titicaca and lake PoopÃ³ although the latter

17
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:35,589
Disappeared in 2016 as a result of climate change and human diverting its waters for mining

18
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:41,470
So it's not just Viracocha who can destroy life in the Andes. No review of new World Myths would be complete

19
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,450
without a quick visit to the Popul Vuh

20
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,860
It's one of our best sources for understanding the world of the Mayans before the arrival of Europeans.

21
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:54,909
You might remember from our creation myths episode that in Mesoamerica the deities went through a number of attempts at birthing the world before?

22
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,890
Getting it right. In the creation story

23
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:02,860
I recounted the animals that were created couldn't talk. No helpful dragons like Yu the Engineer had in China.

24
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:07,720
So the gods started over and as it turns out the creator once messed up humans too.

25
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,389
Let's go to the Thought Bubble. In the beginning the creator made

26
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:17,440
Humans out of wood. These wooden people could do a lot of things we can. Walk, talk, have children, build houses... let's not think too

27
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,619
Hard about out of what but they were dry and yellow and their faces had no expression because they had no minds

28
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:29,229
Nor souls nor hearts. They beat their dogs, and they burned the bottoms of their cooking pot

29
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:36,939
They had forgotten how they were made and couldn't remember any of the names of God, so he said these men will not do either

30
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:42,370
I must destroy them also- and really can you blame them? Dog beaters- unbelievable

31
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:49,029
so the creator sent- you guessed it- a great flood knocking down the houses of the wooden men. The wooden men tried to escape but

32
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:54,520
The animals they had starved and beaten and cooking pots they had burned and the trees with branches they had chopped off all

33
00:02:54,710 --> 00:03:00,939
Turned against them and wouldn't help them; only a few of them escaped from their flood and it is said that their

34
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:05,619
Descendant are the monkeys this is why you should never let a monkey cook- no offense Thoth

35
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,380
After reflecting the creator said it is time

36
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:13,719
I need men on the earth who will know my names who will obey me and

37
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,359
Love me that will nourish and sustain me

38
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:22,809
So he made a man out of cornmeal and used nine kinds of liquor to give strength to his new creations

39
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:30,490
He made four men and four women and they were very happy the creator was scared that these new creations might be too

40
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,359
Powerful though, so the creator blew a mist over their eyes and clouded their vision

41
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:40,540
But the people were still thankful. When the sun came up and the puma and the Jaguar roared the men and the women

42
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,290
Danced with Joy

43
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,819
Because they were alive and possibly drunk

44
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:51,670
Thanks
Thought-bubble the couple book creation that gives us insight into the troubling nature of creation and

45
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:56,529
Humanity. As in many of the other myths we've seen, there's something not quite right about

46
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,159
Mankind at first. the gods always want a big watery

47
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:06,969
Do-over this myth differs from those we saw in the mediterranean world in a few ways first off Viracocha didn't find any human beings

48
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:13,450
Sinless enough to spare also apparently only humans are victims of this flood it's a little bit weird since those

49
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:21,548
Humans are made of wood which usually floats- wouldn't fire work better? I probably would have gone with fire wait my vengeful

50
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:24,939
God perhaps the reason the creator couldn't find a worthy survivor

51
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:32,140
Is that those wooden people were just a bad idea to begin with. this failed creation was the fault of the creator himself not

52
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:38,560
Misbehaving humans. there's something humble about this myth. god messes up, owns up, and tries again

53
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,080
You know that old pithy saying- if at first you don't succeed

54
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:47,259
Wash the entire race of people away in the divine deluge and try again our last a flood story is an aztec tale

55
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,550
from Oaxaca in Mexico

56
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,349
And probably predates

57
00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:57,688
Columbus. In this myth a god called the old one tells one chosen man to Abandon his chores because the world

58
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,959
Is going to be destroyed. the old one tells the man to plant a cedar tree because as we all know gods don't garden and to

59
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,030
find himself a carpenter who can make a canoe. the man does as he's told and miraculously a

60
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,789
giant Cedar Tree grows in A

61
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:19,169
Single night and the man finds a carpenter to build a canoe. the carpenter does fine work, by the way, just not so fine that

62
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,449
He gets to survive what's about to go down

63
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:25,889
You know what happens next the rain comes and the Earth is destroyed

64
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:32,158
but the canoe floats on top of the waters and the man and his family are spared. the rain stops, the Earth dries up, and

65
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:35,279
The man comes out of his canoe and catches some fish to eat

66
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:42,479
But then the old one tells the man that he must not make a fire. soon the old one smelled something from the Earth

67
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:48,209
he come down and he finds the man cooking the fish on a fire the

68
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:54,990
Nerve the old one says who gave you permission to catch fish, and you were told not to make a fire yet

69
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,680
You are doing it. I told you not to make fire. You fool now

70
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,959
You will have to serve as an example for the new people and the old one hits him over the head

71
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,370
Because you did not listen

72
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:09,959
I am going to change you into a howler monkey. in another version of this myth

73
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:15,479
The man survives with a dog and the dog is the one that cooks for him eventually he discovers that the dog is

74
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:21,329
actually a woman and they marry and then they create a new race of humans because

75
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,989
Mythology. no matter which version were talking about though we have to wonder why the man who survived was chosen.

76
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,449
I mean yeah, he can plant a cedar seed

77
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:36,568
But there must have been better option. these myths are fascinating for a number of reasons on a number of fronts notice the monkey

78
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,229
Transformation theme

79
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:45,028
Coincidence? maybe not even though the Mayan Empire and the Aztec empire didn't exist at the same time they were pretty close

80
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,940
Geographically and probably shared some stories

81
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:53,848
They also probably both hung out with monkeys when we compared these flood stories to the ones in Gilgamesh, or the bible there are

82
00:06:54,099 --> 00:07:00,449
Interesting similarities and differences. after all the old one picks out a special individual to be the sole survivor of his

83
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:02,119
Watery reset button

84
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:06,199
but Noah and Utanapishtim were chosen because of their unfailing

85
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:12,229
loyalty and Faith the Survivor of the Old ones flood in pretty much every version is characterized by

86
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:19,849
disobedience it makes one wonder about each cultures respective valuation of loyalty versus independence and whether that aztec

87
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:25,819
Survivor was meant as a disobedient role model or a fish cooking cautionary tale

88
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:32,058
No matter where they come from though flood myths seem to be mainly about punishing humanity for Transgression

89
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:36,049
That's usually wickedness, but sometimes as in Yu the engineer's story

90
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:43,370
It's the poor management of the state by the king. these stories tell people that when bad things like floods happen they happen because

91
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:48,288
Well, we deserve them. they also remind us that humanity is imperfect

92
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:53,089
But the gods who created us are as well- again and again the gods in these stories

93
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:59,179
Feel like they've made a mistake in creating mankind and they want to just start over. no matter how hard they try

94
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:04,039
Humans just kind of keep screwing up even when a God tries to get it right and to start from scratch

95
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:07,968
They can't or maybe we can't because after all

96
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,139
Guess we're only human

97
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,139
