1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,980
When’s the last time you heard a really
good story?

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,069
Maybe it was was a TV show that made you dream
of discovering aliens as a kid, or a book

3
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:09,990
that completely changed how you think about
yourself.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,420
We’re all hardwired to make sense of the
world by telling and being told stories, and

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,470
at the turn of the 20th century, motion pictures
were starting to do just that.

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,130
At first, seeing any film was thrilling
in and of itself, whether it was a Vaudeville

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,480
performer flexing or a train pulling up to
a station.

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,460
But just five or six years into the history
of film, audiences were looking for something

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,720
more than just a technological marvel. So, filmmakers had to "try". Ugh...

10
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,370
The world was primed for artists to prove
this medium was more than just a passing fad.

11
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:37,340
And along came a storyteller who would make
his own magic, take us to the moon, and jumpstart

12
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,050
the first special effects revolution.

13
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:43,290
He changed what filmmakers and audiences believed
was possible, both onscreen and off.

14
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,180
It was time for Georges Méliès.

15
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:57,720
[Intro Music Plays]

16
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,960
As the 19th century gave way to the 20th,

17
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,500
artists, engineers, and self-taught tinkerers
were all pushing the boundaries of film.

18
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,980
"Self-Taught-Tinkerer?" My nickname in high school.

19
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,280
Technical innovations like the Latham Loop
allowed filmmakers to use longer film strips

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,920
in cameras, without them tearing and breaking.

21
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,070
Now they could create longer, more complex
films, which facilitated the very first experiments

22
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,070
with editing.

23
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:19,970
Editing, also known as cutting, is the assembling
of shots to achieve coherence: whether that’s

24
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,840
in the narrative, in space, in time, symbolically,
or thematically.

25
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,070
There are all kinds of ways to join shots
together.

26
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,770
You can use transitions like fades, wipes,
or dissolves,

27
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,660
or you can just cut straight from one shot
to another. Like this...

28
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,560
Ya... see that?

29
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,460
We’ll explore editing techniques in more
detail later in Crash Course Film, and dive

30
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,500
deep into their psychological, emotional,
and even political implications.

31
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,030
For now, all you need to know is that filmmakers
were starting to join shots together, inching

32
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:44,130
their way toward narrative-based films that
explicitly told stories.

33
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,479
One of these soon-to-be filmmakers was Georges
Méliès.

34
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,600
He was born in Paris in 1861, and first achieved
fame as a stage magician.

35
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,640
If you’re familiar with Christopher Nolan’s
The Prestige – his other movie with Christian

36
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,170
Bale – it’ll come as no surprise that
stage magicians were huge celebrities at the

37
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,040
turn of the century.

38
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,940
Also, David Bowie played Tesla in that movie. And that was awesome.

39
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,040
Stage magicians entertained large crowds with illusions

40
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,100
and magic tricks, and decked out their acts
with elaborate sets, costumes, and characters.

41
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,229
And most importantly for us, wove their larger
acts around stories.

42
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,700
By all accounts, Georges Méliès was skilled
and successful.

43
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,120
He owned and operated his own theater, the
Théâtre Robert-Houdin, where he acted as

44
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,770
writer, producer, and director, and designed
the sets and costumes himself.

45
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,640
While Muybridge, Edison, and the Lumière
Brothers were tinkering with motion picture

46
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,450
devices, Méliès was developing magic tricks,
from sophisticated sight gags to theatrical

47
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,450
special effects.

48
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,670
One of his specialties involved using a lantern
projection device to project light effects

49
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,540
onto the audience, making it seem to rain
or snow inside the theater... whoa...

50
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,920
Méliès was invited to one of the Lumière
Brothers’ private cinématographe screenings

51
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,470
before they officially revealed their device
to the world, and he was awestruck.

52
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,320
He tried to buy one of their inventions on
the spot,

53
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,700
but the Lumières weren’t ready to sell.

54
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,710
Méliès didn’t give up, though.

55
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,880
He could already see all the possibilities
a motion picture camera and projector held

56
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,790
for stage magic, and vice versa.

57
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,100
After an intense, transcontinental search,
Méliès ended up buying an Animatograph,

58
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:59,080
Then, get this, he reverse-engineered the Animatograph
so it worked as its own camera, too.

59
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,250
And by April, 1896, he was making and screening
his own films in his theater.

60
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,080
At first, his films looked like Edison’s
or the Lumière Brothers’ – continuous

61
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,170
shots of short skits, quick magic tricks,
or scenes from everyday life.

62
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,480
But then along came one of those happy accidents
that moved cinema forward.

63
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,230
In his autobiography, Méliès describes a
day he was capturing footage on a Paris street

64
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,270
when his camera jammed.

65
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:20,470
Frustrated, he fiddled with the hand crank,
fixed the problem, and started shooting again

66
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,790
after a couple seconds had passed.

67
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,480
When he developed the film later and played
it back, the most amazing thing had happened.

68
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,430
The shot started with people walking, children
skipping, and a horse-drawn omnibus full of

69
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,209
workers trundling up the street.

70
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:33,450
Then, in the blink of an eye, everything changed.

71
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,390
Men turned into women, children were replaced
by horses, and – spookiest of all – the

72
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,739
omnibus full of workers changed into a hearse.

73
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:41,599
In an instant, Méliès realized what had
happened.

74
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,220
When his camera jammed, it stopped shooting
for a moment, and then started capturing images

75
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,330
again after he fixed it.

76
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,660
When the whole sequence was projected, those
two “shots” were joined in an instant

77
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,290
and – poof! – magic happened before his
eyes.

78
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,180
Méliès had found a way to perform actual
magic with editing, to fool an audience and

79
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,650
pull off illusions he’d never been able
to on stage.

80
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,190
He began making “trick films” with a vengeance,
using the power of editing and special effects

81
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,250
to do the impossible on screen: like levitating
heads, making people disappear, or changing

82
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,250
an object’s size or shape.

83
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,879
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble to reveal
a few of this magician’s secrets!

84
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,840
Méliès pioneered the first double exposure
in 1898, by running the film negative through

85
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,759
the camera twice before developing it.

86
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,680
When you do this correctly, both images appear
on screen simultaneously, though the second

87
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,770
image usually appears faded or ghostly.

88
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,379
This technique led him to invent the split
screen, in which he covered half the frame,

89
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,720
shot his footage, rewound the film, covered
the other half of the frame, and shot new footage.

90
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,400
When the film was developed, the two images
appeared side-by-side in real time.

91
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,500
This was a trick he used over and over again,
often to allow actors to perform opposite themselves.

92
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,920
It's a great technique that many youtubers use.

93
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,460
He further refined this trick with a process

94
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,380
called matting, where he’d paint black shapes
on a glass plate attached to the lens of the camera.

95
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,020
Those black shapes kept light from exposing
those portions of the film as he shot a scene.

96
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:54,229
Then, Méliès could paint the other portions
of the glass plate, while leaving the original

97
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:57,370
shapes clear, re-shoot the scene, and both
exposures would combine.

98
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,490
We call these techniques in-camera effects
because they’re produced inside the camera,

99
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,080
rather than after the film has been shot.

100
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,700
And Melies used them and many others to masterful
effect.

101
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,620
Thanks Thought Bubble!

102
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,500
The laws of physics were no match for Méliès
and his camera and editing tricks.

103
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,860
No match for me either. Can you make me float up?

104
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,860
Nick (off camera): We can't do that.

105
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,320
...or something.

106
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,400
He could manipulate time.

107
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:19,419
He could manipulate space.

108
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:22,780
And he could harness the fact that all film
presents an illusion, to push his own illusions

109
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,780
even further.

110
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,919
Before long, Méliès began incorporating
elements of his theatrical shows into his

111
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:31,190
films – the elaborate costumes, the lavish
sets, the exaggerated props, /and/ the stories.

112
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,470
To our eyes today, his films have a distinct
“stagey” quality.

113
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:37,119
By that I mean, the camera is almost always
set back from the action, capturing an entire

114
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:40,669
scene in one shot, roughly from the perspective
of an audience member in a theater.

115
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:43,849
We call this style of framing Proscenium Arch,
named for the arch over the front of the stage

116
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:44,849
in a theater.

117
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:48,259
It’s not used as much today, but you might
recognize the style from Wes Anderson movies.

118
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:51,680
To us, the scenes in Méliès’ films might
feel static and too long, because, outside

119
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,259
of all his special effects editing, he only
cuts between scenes.

120
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:57,729
Not to mention, his characters might seem
one-dimensional, and their gestures can feel

121
00:05:57,729 --> 00:05:58,729
over-the-top.

122
00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:03,080
But put yourself in the shoes of a filmgoer
in 1901 Paris, having seen nothing but slice-of-life

123
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,659
actualitiés and Vaudeville performers on
screen.

124
00:06:05,659 --> 00:06:09,740
The relative sophistication, ambitious vision,
and powerful special effects of Méliès films

125
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,160
would be downright thrilling.

126
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,460
But Méliès wasn’t the only filmmaker at work during the very first years of cinema.

127
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,900
Alice Guy-Blaché was a secretary for the major French film company Gaumont, who went on to become their head of production.

128
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,220
The first known female filmmaker, Guy-Blaché directed more than 1,000 films,

129
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:29,200
was a pioneer in color tinting, rudimentary sound and picture sync, and ultimately opened her own film studio.

130
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,920
Blanche also worked on the cutting edge of narrative fiction, like with her film The Cabbage Fairy,

131
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,580
before she eventually lost her company and stopped making films altogether in 1920.

132
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,280
In 1902, Méliès released his masterpiece,
A Trip to the Moon, loosely

133
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,940
based on the Jules Verne novel.

134
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:45,850
This 14-minute film follows a group of scientists
who travel to the moon, sleep under the stars,

135
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,720
battle some aliens, and escape back to Earth
triumphant.

136
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,780
Even if you haven’t seen the whole thing,
you probably know the iconic image of the

137
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,000
“man in the moon” with the space capsule
stuck in his eye.

138
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,189
A Trip to the Moon was made up of 825 feet
of film – three times the average length

139
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:00,099
of Edison or Lumière films of the time.

140
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:03,279
This film incorporates many of Méliès’
innovations – his trick photography, his

141
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:07,680
fantastical settings, and his ambitious storytelling
– all in service of a large scale, relatively

142
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,159
complex, narrative fiction film.

143
00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:10,560
It was a massive international success.

144
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,139
In fact, it made so much money that Thomas
Edison – among others – made illegal copies

145
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:17,889
of it and lined his pockets screening the
film as his own... what a guy!

146
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:19,180
But it wasn’t just a financial hit.

147
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,789
It also had a profound effect on other filmmakers
of the time, and expanded what people thought

148
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:24,580
was possible, narratively and aesthetically.

149
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,849
Not only could films take us into space and
let us battle with aliens, but they could

150
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:33,460
also sustain our attention for almost 15 minutes
and tell stories that unfolded over multiple scenes.

151
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,460
A Trip to the Moon gets referenced
everywhere from Martin Scorsese’s Hugo,

152
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:40,240
which features a loving portrait of Georges
Méliès, to the Smashing Pumpkins’ 1996

153
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,140
music video for Tonight, Tonight.

154
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,940
And perhaps, most importantly

155
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,380
Matthew Gaydos’ arm.

156
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,429
Okay you can leave now, Matt.

157
00:07:47,429 --> 00:07:50,280
A Trip to the Moon was by no means the only
film Méliès made.

158
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:55,080
In his prime, he made between 25 and 75 films
per year, a huge number by any standard.

159
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,569
He founded a production company called Star
Film and built a large studio in Montreuil, France,

160
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:00,030
just outside Paris.

161
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:03,589
The studio was constructed like a giant greenhouse,
to let in as much natural light as possible.

162
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:06,590
And it was big enough to house Méliès’
massive painted sets and backdrops.

163
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:09,909
And though we’re decades away from color
film stock, audiences were already seeing

164
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:11,009
films with color in them.

165
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:14,349
To achieve this effect, individual frames
of film were hand-tinted or painted – to

166
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:17,029
color an explosion orange or a dress red or
the sun yellow.

167
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:20,830
It was a costly, time-consuming process, and
had to be repeated with every copy of the film.

168
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,830
And I'm glad I didn't have to do it.

169
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,929
For a showman like Méliès, however, no bit
of magic was too elaborate.

170
00:08:25,929 --> 00:08:30,429
It’s even said he employed twenty-one women to hand-tint his films at what must have cost a pretty penny.

171
00:08:30,429 --> 00:08:31,659
I'm glad I didn't have to pay for it.

172
00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:35,299
Sadly, the high cost of his productions, legal
challenges from rivals, and the devastation

173
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:38,549
of Europe during World War I forced Méliès
out of the film business by 1917.

174
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:42,509
In the 1920s, he was living in obscurity,
selling sweets at the Montparnasse station

175
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,750
in Paris, as anyone who’s seen Hugo knows.

176
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,090
Had his story ended there, it would’ve been
a tragedy.But this is the movie business.

177
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,300
And there’s nothing we like better than
a comeback story.

178
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,880
In the late 1920s, journalists and filmmakers
who’d been influenced by Méliès’ films

179
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,500
tracked him down to celebrate his contributions
to the art of cinema.

180
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,860
Someday I hope people track me down and do that... for me.

181
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,140
And in October, 1931, Méliès was made a

182
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:07,530
Knight of the Legion of Honor, the highest
achievement in French military or civil affairs.

183
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,890
The medal was presented to him by Louis Lumière
himself.

184
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:14,250
So Georges Méliès, the Parisian stage magician
who brought science fiction, special effects,

185
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:18,060
and more sophisticated narrative storytelling
to film, was ultimately honored by those who

186
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,340
knew his work the best.

187
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:22,820
Both his peers and his rivals agreed that
his illusions changed history and took audiences

188
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,630
to new and thrilling places.

189
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,000
Places like the moon... and Matthew Gaydos' arm.

190
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,770
Today we introduced Georges Méliès, the
magician-turned-filmmaker whose mistakes,

191
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:36,330
experiments, and ambitious storytelling led
to some huge advancements in early film production.

192
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:40,130
We discussed how editing and special effects
can enhance the very nature of film as an

193
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:43,490
illusion, and how audiences were hungry for
longer, more complex narratives.

194
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:46,390
And next time, we’ll learn about some more
experimentation with editing techniques, and

195
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:52,020
a filmmaker who started to define the visual
language of film as we know it today. Wheezy Waiter, not Wheezy Waiter.

196
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,670
