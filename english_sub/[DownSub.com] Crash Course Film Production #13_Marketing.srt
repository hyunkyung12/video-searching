1
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,440
Let's say you made a movie.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,820
You wrote a script, prepared the shoot, assembled
a cast and crew, shot the film, edited it,

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,150
and sound mixed the thing until it’s ready
for the world.

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,420
And it’s awesome.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,420
Congratulations!

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,160
Now… you just have to convince an audience
to come see it.

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,660
These days, that’s more important than ever.

8
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,990
With hundreds of films, TV series, and online
videos competing for our attention, filmmakers

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,059
and distribution companies need to find creative
ways to make their content stand out.

10
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:30,110
From posters and trailers to celebrity press
junkets, let’s take a peek at the world

11
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:30,720
of marketing.

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:43,800
[Opening Music Plays]

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,710
In the earliest days of film, movies were

14
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:46,710
the marketing.

15
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,600
People bought tickets just to see pictures
move on a screen.

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,670
As it became clear that film was going to
endure as a source of mass entertainment and

17
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,079
communication, a permanent infrastructure
emerged – things like movie studios and

18
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,079
theater chains.

19
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:59,910
Those studios started making more movies to
keep up with demand.

20
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,489
And, suddenly, moviegoers had options!

21
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:04,650
Audiences also became more sophisticated viewers.

22
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,790
They wanted stories, and they wanted stars.

23
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:10,250
Film studios and distributors were faced with
greater competition and needed to find ways

24
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,200
to persuade people to see their film, instead
of somebody else’s.

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,670
That’s where marketing comes in.

26
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,420
And, in fact, many of the elements of cinema’s
earliest marketing campaigns are still with

27
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,420
us today.

28
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,230
In the 1910s, the studios that made and distributed
films noticed that more people bought tickets

29
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:27,030
for movies starring actors like Florence Lawrence,
Mary Pickford, and Lillian Gish.

30
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,120
So they began to market their films based
on celebrities, which helped create the star system.

31
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,229
Celebrities continue to be a powerful weapon
in a film’s marketing arsenal to this day.

32
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:39,420
They can be deployed to talk shows, magazine
spreads, or press junkets, where hundreds

33
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,650
of journalists are wined, dined, and given
a few precious moments to interview a personality.

34
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:48,040
Today’s celebrities also leverage their
own social media to increase hype around their movies.

35
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,950
But as flashy as the star system is, in many
ways, the cornerstone of film marketing is

36
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,460
the poster or one sheet.

37
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,170
Whether they’re organized around an iconic
image from the film, or covered with the movie’s

38
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:01,229
most famous actors, these graphic designs
can be used in print ads, transformed into

39
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:03,170
billboards, or displayed outside theaters.

40
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:06,710
The best posters represent a movie in a single,
powerful image.

41
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,380
Think of the shark rising up toward the swimmer
on the Jaws poster, or the moth over Jodie

42
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,450
Foster’s mouth from The Silence of the Lambs.

43
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,730
Posters often include taglines as well – brief,
memorable catch-phrases that sum up the theme

44
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:17,730
of the movie.

45
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,499
Like Alien: “In space, no one can hear you
scream.”

46
00:02:20,499 --> 00:02:25,319
Or The Shawshank Redemption: “Fear can hold
you prisoner, hope can set you free.”

47
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,439
Posters might also feature quotes from film
critics.

48
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,510
Remember, this is all an act of persuasion,
so if critics are raving, people might get

49
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,860
curious enough to see a movie for themselves.

50
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,750
Trailers or previews were another early development
in film marketing.

51
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,440
The earliest trailers appeared at the end
of serials, early short films that told a

52
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,719
longer story in weekly installments.

53
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,680
Each episode would end with some kind of cliffhanger,
and include a shot from the next week’s film.

54
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,920
Once feature films became the norm, studios
would mine a film for shots of its most famous actors.

55
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,120
Then, they would pair those shots with title
cards – or after the advent of sound, a

56
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,240
narrator – to tell the audience how incredible
the movie was going to be.

57
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:10,559
In the 1960s, American movie trailers began
to break this mold.

58
00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:14,249
Alfred Hitchcock famously starred in the trailer
for Psycho, in which he gave the audience

59
00:03:14,249 --> 00:03:18,000
a walking tour of the film’s set, describing
where various grisly murders took place.

60
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,359
In 1964, Stanley Kubrick made his own trailer
for Dr. Strangelove.

61
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:31,930
It’s a funny, fragmented creation, intercutting
very short clips from the movie with title

62
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,000
cards that ask the movie’s big questions.

63
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,080
Since the 1970s, films have also advertised
on television.

64
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,280
Jaws was among the first, featuring a shortened
version of the theatrical trailer.

65
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,549
And during this time, another big change came
to Hollywood marketing.

66
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:58,449
Before the 1970s, the marketing departments
of major movie studios began their work after

67
00:03:58,449 --> 00:03:59,479
a film was done.

68
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:02,779
The studio produced the movie, and then the
marketing people sold it to an audience.

69
00:04:02,779 --> 00:04:07,419
But by the 1980s, those studios had all been
purchased by big multinational corporations,

70
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:11,379
where the marketing professionals were consulted
before many products were fully developed.

71
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:15,700
That strategy trickled down, and by the mid-1980s
the in-house marketing departments of places

72
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,540
like Paramount, Warner Brothers, and 20th
Century Fox began weighing in on which films

73
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,180
should actually get made.

74
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,870
Studios like Marvel have taken this to a whole
new level, staking out release dates and creating

75
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,960
promotional material for movies before they’ve
developed a script, hired actors, or picked

76
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,960
a director.

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,270
Meanwhile, sponsorships and product placements
have existed in some form since the dawn of

78
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,040
movies, but in the 1980s, they reached a whole
new level.

79
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,680
Companies like Coca-Cola or Frito-Lay would
pay to have their products featured in movies

80
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,900
aimed at an audience they hope to reach.

81
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,900
And it often worked!

82
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,590
For instance, after Hershey’s agreed to
spend $1 million marketing Stephen Spielberg’s

83
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:52,840
E.T. in exchange for a prominent use of Reese’s
Pieces in the film, sales of the candy jumped

84
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,680
by a whopping 65% in just two weeks!

85
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,760
And the Internet has revolutionized movie
marketing in many ways.

86
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,120
Not only is it cheaper to deliver trailers
over the web, but marketing departments can

87
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,040
now target their material to very specific
audiences.

88
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,420
And savvy use of social media can amplify
the marketing team’s message.

89
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:12,520
So rather than paying to advertise on every
major television network, the marketing team

90
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,270
of a new animated film can aim ads directly
at, say, people whose browser histories indicate

91
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,300
that they have young kids.

92
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,480
Now, when you’re marketing a film, first
you’ll have to figure out how much you’ll

93
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,600
need to spend.

94
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,880
Generally speaking, marketing costs about
an additional quarter to a half of a film’s budget.

95
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,590
So if you’ve made a new comic book movie
for $150 million, you might have to spend

96
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,580
another $75 million to make sure people know
it’s coming out.

97
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,670
And the problem is, now your movie has to
make $225 million just to break even!

98
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,800
So where does all that money go?

99
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,640
Well, the biggest chunk of a marketing budget
falls under something called Prints and Advertising,

100
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,860
or P&A.

101
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,060
Marketing departments will often buy print
ad space in local newspapers and on billboards,

102
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,550
advertise on the radio, or make a series of
teasers and trailers.

103
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,140
And depending on /how/ you release your film,
the cost of P&A can change.

104
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:58,150
Each of these avenues has different marketing
requirements, expenses, and strategies.

105
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,500
A theatrical release is generally pricier.

106
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,120
The film itself has to be physically delivered
to theaters – which used to cost more when

107
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,290
that meant hauling around heavy metal cans
full of physical film.

108
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,630
But there are benefits, too.

109
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:12,430
There’s still some prestige attached to
having your film play in a movie theater.

110
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:16,920
And films have to have at least a small theatrical
release to be eligible for major awards like

111
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,180
the Oscars, for instance.

112
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,870
And if you make a big enough marketing splash
when your film opens in theaters, by the time

113
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:24,740
it comes out on other platforms, people might
remember hearing about it.

114
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,050
Other films find release on cable television.

115
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,970
Marketing these films is somewhat less expensive,
and the audience is easier to find –

116
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,460
because they're already watching the channel!

117
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,310
Channels like HBO, Showtime, and even the
History Channel have produced and distributed

118
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,080
movies and miniseries to great success in
recent years.

119
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,780
Then, there are paid streaming services like
Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu.

120
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,180
They not only distribute films that have had
a theatrical run, but also let you stream

121
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,870
original movies on your television, tablet,
or phone whenever and wherever you want.

122
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,890
These companies know more about who their
audience is than anyone else.

123
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,840
They know what you’ve watched before, what
you’ve searched for, and what you might

124
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,460
be interested in seeing next.

125
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,980
This level of detail is a dream for movie
marketing executives… and a little bit

126
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,560
creepy if you think about it too much.

127
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,300
Some movies get released on free streaming
services, like YouTube or Vimeo.

128
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,110
These films often aim their marketing materials
at prominent users of a platform, hoping that

129
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:14,830
someone with a few million followers will
spread the word about their movie.

130
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,500
This kind of marketing can be less expensive,
but more time-consuming.

131
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,780
Movies also get released on home video formats
like DVD and Blu-ray, and by film festivals,

132
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,120
both live and online.

133
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,390
Some movies use a successful film festival
run to market their films to buyers – distribution

134
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:31,730
companies who will then release the film theatrically
or through video-on-demand.

135
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:36,550
These distribution companies, from the major
studios to independent companies like A24

136
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:40,640
or Magnolia Pictures, will use their expertise
and infrastructure to execute a marketing

137
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,170
strategy and help the film find its audience.

138
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:47,070
Film festivals also offer movies a chance
to be seen by critics, whose reviews can boost

139
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,640
interest in a film and provide marketing departments
with quotes they can put on the posters and

140
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,640
DVD art.

141
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,889
Needless to say, different kinds of movies
aimed at different audiences require very

142
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:56,990
different marketing and distribution strategies.

143
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,530
And while a film’s success relies on more
than just its marketing, every film does

144
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:01,590
need to find its audience.

145
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,360
For big-budget movies with a theatrical release,
the opening weekend box office is key to their success.

146
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,750
The money and good press from a big opening
weekend can lead all the way to massive home

147
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,800
video sales, successful sequels, and even
theme park rides.

148
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,150
So there’s a lot riding on the marketing
departments of major studios to get people

149
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,280
buying tickets for their films right out of
the gate.

150
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,080
They have some help, because many huge Hollywood
movies are based on characters or stories

151
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,530
that people are familiar with.

152
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,590
Sequels, prequels, and reboots, oh my!

153
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:29,430
Since audiences are already pre-aware of these
stories, the job of the marketing department

154
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:33,700
is to use tools like trailers, posters, commercials,
or talk show appearances to make people want

155
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,710
to see these movies right away.

156
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:39,309
Big-budget marketing efforts create a vicious
cycle, though, since the high cost of a national

157
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:43,458
campaign means the film has to make even more
money at the box office to break even.

158
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:47,600
Smaller, independent movies don’t have the
resources to throw 100 million dollars into

159
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,649
marketing, but they don’t necessarily need
to.

160
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:53,149
These movies are often made for much less
money, so they don’t need to break box office

161
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:56,009
records on their opening weekend to be a success
and pay back investors.

162
00:08:56,009 --> 00:09:00,559
So whether you’ve made the latest Marvel
movie or a DIY indie on your cell phone, marketing

163
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:04,120
is an essential piece of the filmmaking puzzle
when it comes to finding an audience and getting

164
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,569
them excited to see your film.

165
00:09:05,569 --> 00:09:08,809
Today we talked about the history of marketing,
from the earliest days through innovative

166
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:10,360
online campaigns.

167
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,050
We looked at the ways marketing professionals
use things like posters, trailers, and celebrity

168
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,480
interviews to drive awareness of films.

169
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,120
And we explored the costs and benefits of
various strategies for marketing large-scale

170
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,689
blockbusters versus micro-budget indies.

171
00:09:22,689 --> 00:09:26,240
Next time we’ll spend some time exploring
that age old question: should you go to film

172
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,449
school, or not?

173
00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:31,140

association with PBS Digital Studios.
