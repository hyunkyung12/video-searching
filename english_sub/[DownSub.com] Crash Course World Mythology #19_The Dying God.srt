00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270
Hey there, I'm Mike Rugnetta! This is Crash Course Mythology and today

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:09,120
We're going to talk about the dying god, a specific archetype of god that might seem counterintuitive,

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,260
considering lots of the myths we've already talked about feature gods who are immortal.

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:22,520
The dying god trope, though, is one found in many regions throughout the world, but especially in the Greco-Hellenistic Roman World, which includes Egypt.

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,680
Don't worry, though! Thoth is fine, he's just more like a death secretary. Alright, let's go.

6
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:37,740
*Crash Course Intro*

7
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:44,120
The dying god is, you guessed it, a god who dies and is often but not always reborn.

8
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,420
Sometimes gods die for the benefit of their people, in which case,

9
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,780
they're a savior as we discussed in a previous episode. Other times,

10
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,840
the god is reborn actually or symbolically. So these stories also have

11
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,380
something in common with the myths that represent regeneration or seasonal rebirth.

12
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:05,340
In the west, the most well-known story of a dying god is, of course, the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus.

13
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,860
We're not going to get into that one here because it's a widely studied story that y'all are likely familiar with.

14
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,600
Instead, let's start with an iconic dying god from Ancient Greece.

15
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,140
The Story of Adonis.

16
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,300
Nowadays, calling some dude an Adonis is shorthand for saying that he is super hot.

17
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,440
But, originally, Adonis was the Greco-Roman Version of a semitic God,  sometimes Identified with Osiris.

18
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,140
In Semitic languages like Hebrew, Adonis's Name is Adonai or Lord.

19
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,320
So Adonis's significance goes way beyond killer abs.

20
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,600
In some versions of the Adonis's story, his mother was a virgin.

21
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,920
In others, he's the result of incest between his mother and her father, the King.

22
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,240
Still, other versions claim that Adonis may have been born out of a myrrh tree.

23
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,680
So, for those of you keeping track at home, we've had

24
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:54,880
several brain baby, a thigh baby, one stone baby and now our first tree birth.

25
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,560
Probably the best known version of the Adonis myth comes from Ovid's

26
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:04,040
metamorphoses which details Venus's mad love for the beautiful young god.

27
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,020
However, we can't give Adonis all the credit.

28
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,060
Venus only fell for him after one of Cupid's arrows grazed her breast.

29
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,180
She leaves Olympus to chase Adonis around the wood.

30
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,920
She warned him not to be too risky in his hunting, but as you can probably guess,

31
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:23,620
Adonis does not listen. He's killed by a boar that gore him in the groin,

32
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,420
Ouch.

33
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,220
When she finds him dying, Venus is distraught.

34
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,360
Brutal.

35
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,260
Venus, history's first black metal lyricist.

36
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:58,680
She, then, sprinkles nectar on Adonis's blood and it transforms into a red anemone flower.

37
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:04,220
This flower is born, lives, dies and is reborn again - each year - like flowers do,

38
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,980
so it's a symbolic reminder of the cyclical nature of the seasons and perhaps, our grief.

39
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,440
Thoth - you get all misty-eyed or is it just allergies?

40
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:20,120
Seeing the same flower die every year might be kind of sad, but in another way, it's a hopeful symbol,

41
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,580
for the idea that maybe death isn't final after all.

42
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,200
Now, let's turn to one of the most famous dying gods, our friend Odin,

43
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:34,880
who hanged himself from the World Tree - Yggdrasil - as a sacrifice in order to gain  the Knowledge of Runes.

44
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,020
He doesn't really die in most versions of the myth, but he does suffer.

45
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,400
Both from hanging and from being pierced in the side with a sword.

46
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,320
Note the parallels with the death of Jesus here #dyinggods

47
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,880
There's also Balder, a Norse god, who actually does die.

48
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,740
Like Adonis, Balder is often described as beautiful and beloved by all the gods

49
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,380
Except, of course, for Loki, who as I may have mentioned is: the worst.

50
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,380
Loki was jealous of Balder's popularity and schemed to have him killed

51
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:07,350
by the one thing that he was vulnerable to: you're not going to guess what it is

52
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,720
It's mistletoe.

53
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,660
So think of that at the next office Christmas Party, hm?

54
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,780
His mother, Frigg, had gotten every substance on Earth to swear not to bring harm to Balder,

55
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,880
except from mistletoe,

56
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,840
because she thought that it didn't matter.

57
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,900
Loki crafted a dart from mistletoe and got the blind god,

58
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,520
Hodr, to throw it at Balder while everyone else was having fun throwing stuff at him

59
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,420
because he's invulnerable.

60
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,519
Norse gods sure do know how to party.

61
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,869
Balder dies and goes down to single hockey stick, Hell, the place.

62
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,380
His mother asks for volunteers to try to bring him back and

63
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,920
Balder's brother, Hermod steps up,  saddles up and rides down to hell.

64
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,800
Hel, the person who minds Hell, the place,  isn't particularly moved.

65
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,140
But as underworld gods are often want to do she decides to make a deal.

66
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,940
She says that if everyone on Earth will weep for Balder and she'll let him return.

67
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:05,280
Turns out, Balder was so beloved that everyone and everything on Earth did weep for him,

68
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,940
Except for one giantess named Thokk who says,

69
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,260
Harsh, Thokk. What Balder ever do to you? Jeez.

70
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:28,220
So Balder doesn't come back from the dead all because of Thokk.

71
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,360
Though, if you ask the other gods, they'll point out something very interesting,

72
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,780
isn't Loki, who's the worst, a shapeshifter

73
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,080
And have you ever seen him and Thokk in the same room? Just Saying.

74
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,480
These are the reasons Loki Is the worst.

75
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,420
Far from being a bittersweet reminder of life's impermanence,

76
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:54,440
Balder's death foreshadows Ragnarok, the literal Death and Rebirth of everything.

77
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,100
More on that in a few episodes.

78
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,435
(If the world doesn't end)

79
00:05:57,435 --> 00:06:02,360
The story of the Corn Mother, a great goddess from native American Mythology is one where the dying god,

80
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,400
specifically makes sacrifices in order to bring salvation to her people.

81
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,420
Thought Bubble, this one's a little grisly but we think he can handle it.

82
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,820
The first mother was born from a drop of dew during the time when the All-Maker was creating all sorts of things.

83
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:20,080
She was a beautiful young woman who upon being born proclaimed,

84
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,260
All-Maker certainly loved her and together they bore the first people.

85
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,120
Following All-Maker's instructions, the people learned to hunt.

86
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,880
In time, they became so good at it that they exhausted all the game on the Earth.

87
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:39,260
Then, the people began to starve and this made the first mother very sad because

88
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,280
she had made the people and now couldn't do anything to help.

89
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,020
Her husband didn't want to see the first mother so sad and asked

90
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,075
what he could do to stop her weeping.

91
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:51,240
The first mother replied with the only thing he could do:

92
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:52,710
Kill her.

93
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,020
Her husband refused at first but eventually

94
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,880
he relented and asked the first mother, how he should do it,

95
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,600
first mother told him that when the sun was at its highest point,

96
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,060
he should kill her and have two of her sons dragged her by the hair

97
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,760
over the barren Earth until all the flesh had been scraped from her body, then

98
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,720
they were to take her bones and bury them and wait seven months before returning.

99
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:22,260
At this time, their mother's flesh would feed the people. The husband and son did what the first mother said and waited

100
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:28,340
sadly for seven months to return to the place where first mother's flesh had been stripped from her bone.

101
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:35,340
There they found plants with tassels of hair, silky like the first mother's and sweet fruit that they could eat.

102
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:41,260
This was corn and as the first mother promised, it fed the people. From then on,

103
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,500
her sacrifice being repeated and renewed every seven months.

104
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,780
Thank you, Thought Bubble.

105
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,160
After the discovery of corn, the people of Earth went back to the place where they'd

106
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,080
buried her bones and they found another plant with sacred leaves,

107
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,520
that when burned would clear their minds and help them with their prayers.

108
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,160
This was tobacco.

109
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,680
So, thanks? Yeah that one's a lot more tricky, just ask...

110
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,840
Well we're gonna get to trickster gods in the next episode.

111
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,760
So, the first mother now called the Corn Mother

112
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,040
saved the native American people from starvation. There's an amazing blend of archetypes in this story.

113
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:20,040
Obviously, there's the Earth Mother who gave birth to humanity, and cares for them.

114
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:26,300
Like human mothers, she weeps at her helplessness when her children suffer and she's willing to sacrifice anything,

115
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,308
including her body so that her children will survive.

116
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:35,940
In this sacrifice, she also plays the role of the savior which is more typically a role performed by male gods in myths.

117
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,880
The Corn Mother is also a culture hero, her sacrifice transforms a hunting people into an agricultural people,

118
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,440
though many native Americans in North America pursued both hunting and agriculture simultaneously

119
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,140
as means of subsistence.

120
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:55,880
The Corn Mother here by providing an alternative form of food enabled the animals to recover, providing game for the people.

121
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:01,200
And in addition to providing food,  the Corn Mother gave the people tobacco which became an important part

122
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,620
of their religious ritual and other practices. Many of the dying god stories involve cycles,

123
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:10,240
whether it's Adonis and the annual flower or the corn Mother and the annual harvest,

124
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,800
these stories remind us that birth is often twinned with death,

125
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,860
which may make the latter inevitability easier to accept,

126
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:25,320
and the Corn Mother story adds an extra layer in reminding us that motherly sacrifices enable all life.

127
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,300
We've seen the idea of god sacrificing themselves as the foundation of Creation before,

128
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:37,300
Tongu's body became the Earth's, the body and bones of Amir became the Earth's and the Mountains, and his skull became the sky

129
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:43,520
Gaia gave birth to the mountains of the oceans. It's not surprising that throughout most of human history,

130
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:49,020
when child birth was much more likely to end in the mother's death, that we find stories

131
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:53,040
where gods sacrificed themselves so that humans can live.

132
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,170
