1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,120
Hey!

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,120
Hello.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,120
Can anybody hear me?

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,120
You can?

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,119
Good!

6
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:09,120
That’s because of something called synchronous
sound.

7
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,650
It means that the words I’m saying right
now are being recorded, then matched with

8
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:12,650
the video.

9
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,929
So when you watch this, the sound of my voice
is in sync with the image of me talking.

10
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:16,929
Talking.

11
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:17,929
Talking.

12
00:00:17,929 --> 00:00:20,619
We take that for granted today, but for the
first few decades of film history, it wasn’t

13
00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:21,619
possible.

14
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:24,160
Theaters had to supply music, sound effects,
and narration through phonographs or live

15
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,160
performances.

16
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,500
And when dialogue was absolutely necessary,
filmmakers had actors mouth the words, and

17
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,919
then insert title cards – or inter-titles
– in the middle of scene so the audience

18
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:33,200
could read the dialogue for themselves.

19
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,750
It took years of guess-work, tinkering, and
experimentation to make cinema sound the way

20
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,750
it does today.

21
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:42,140
But when sound finally arrived, it changed
the way movies were made and watched, forever.

22
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,140
WHAAAT?

23
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,260
You can hear me say WHAAAT now, thanks to
that.

24
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:58,440
[Intro Music]

25
00:00:58,449 --> 00:01:01,890
Nothing shook the foundations of the film
industry like the coming of sound.

26
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,790
By the mid-1920s, the major studios were churning
out movie after movie, the star system was

27
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,250
in full swing, and cinema had become an integral
part of popular culture.

28
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,680
But in order to sync pre-recorded sound to
moving pictures, artists and engineers had

29
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,220
to overcome a few major hurdles.

30
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,680
The first – and most important – was synchronization.

31
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,581
How do you get the image and sound to match
up?

32
00:01:18,581 --> 00:01:21,910
At the time, image and sound were recorded
and played back using different devices, so

33
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:23,400
there was no easy way to link them.

34
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,840
Second, microphone technology was fairly primitive.

35
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,770
Sound quality wasn’t good, and the mics
themselves were too big to conceal.

36
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,640
Third, the process of recording and playing
back sound typically required electricity.

37
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,800
That meant production companies would need
more equipment, larger crews, and access to

38
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,800
power.

39
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,670
And finally, there was the problem of amplification.

40
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,820
Speaker technology at the time simply wasn’t
loud enough to fill a big theater.

41
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,860
And the search for solutions to these problems
went as far back as the 1880s.

42
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,820
In 1889, Thomas Edison’s assistant, W.K.L.

43
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,880
Dickson, achieved a kind of rough synchronization
between the phonograph and the kinetoscope.

44
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,960
Eventually he came up with a device called
the kinetophone that used a system of pulleys

45
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,280
to connect the two devices.

46
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,500
Thing is, it was buggy – everything had
to be just right, or the whole system fell

47
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,500
apart.

48
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,320
Luckily, at the same time as Dickson, inventors
across Europe and the United States were working

49
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,160
towards the goal of synchronous sound films.

50
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,899
In fact, three separate synchronizing devices
were on display at the Paris World Exhibition

51
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:09,979
in 1900.

52
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,430
None of them solved the whole problem, though.

53
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,599
The common thread in all these early attempts
was the phonograph.

54
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,890
That’s what they used to play back the pre-recorded
sound to accompany the film.

55
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,830
And the problem was, it was really hard to
keep things in sync, you guys.

56
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,749
If the phonograph needle skipped, or the film
jammed in the projector – which happened

57
00:02:22,749 --> 00:02:26,069
all the time – it was nearly impossible
to re-sync the two without starting all over

58
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:27,069
again.

59
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:29,950
More importantly, the phonograph relied on
cylinders or discs that could only hold four

60
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,120
or five minutes worth of sound.

61
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,189
By 1905, virtually all films ran longer than
five minutes.

62
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:37,340
Since the phonograph seemed like a dead end,
engineers started to look for ways to record

63
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,629
sound photographically.

64
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:39,629
WHAAAT?

65
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:40,629
That’s right!

66
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:44,319
They hoped to translate sound waves into patterns
of light that could be recorded directly onto

67
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,379
a strip of film.

68
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:47,859
They called this technology sound-on-film.

69
00:02:47,859 --> 00:02:50,390
Which is not creative naming, but it works.

70
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,720
The first experiments with sound-on-film began
in 1910 when Eugène Augustin Lauste, who

71
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,450
worked for Dickson in Edison’s lab, successfully
recorded sound right next to the image track

72
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,450
on film.

73
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:03,260
In 1919, a trio of German inventors came up
with something called the Tri-Ergon process.

74
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:07,231
They used a photoelectric cell to translate
sound waves into electric impulses, which

75
00:03:07,231 --> 00:03:11,209
were then converted into light waves and recorded
photographically onto the film strip.

76
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:14,670
Most notably, they innovated a flywheel into
the projector that would keep the film speed

77
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,670
consistent.

78
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,140
This mechanism was so superior to anything
else at the time – and its patent so airtight

79
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,340
– that everyone had to pay royalties to
the Tri-Ergon creators to use it.

80
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,299
At roughly the same time, an American inventor
named Lee de Forest developed his own sound-on-film

81
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:27,299
system.

82
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:30,090
It was very similar to the Tri-Ergon process,
but de Forest’s version solved the problem

83
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,090
of amplification.

84
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:35,739
In 1907, while working on radio broadcast
technology, de Forest patented the Audion

85
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:37,170
3-Electrode Amplifier Tube.

86
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,170
My nickname in high school.

87
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:41,549
This was a vacuum tube that amplified sound
and sent it into a speaker, sort of like the

88
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:45,050
way a projector’s lens takes an image and
blows it up so you can see it on a large screen.

89
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,840
In 1919 de Forest realized his technology
might help achieve synchronous sound, and

90
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,950
by 1922 he’d developed the process enough
to test it commercially.

91
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:55,489
He formed the De Forest Phonofilm Company
and set about making some of the very first

92
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:56,489
sync-sound films.

93
00:03:56,489 --> 00:03:57,790
He called them phonofilms.

94
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:01,159
Most were just musical performances, vaudeville
acts, and speeches simply meant to showcase

95
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,200
the technology, but a few were narrative films.

96
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,900
By the mid-1920s, a hundred exhibitors in
the Eastern United States, Britain, and Canada

97
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,189
had wired their movie theaters for sound,
specifically to screen de Forest’s phonofilms.

98
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:14,139
But Hollywood wasn’t ready for it yet because,
the American studios were very good at producing

99
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:15,139
silent movies.

100
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:17,959
And they weren’t convinced that it was worth
the expense to change the way they made and

101
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,949
showed films just to accommodate sound.

102
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:23,050
Studio heads thought that “talking pictures,”
or talkies, were just a novelty that would

103
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,050
fade away.

104
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:28,250
That began to change in 1926, when a subsidiary
of AT&T introduced the Vitaphone system.

105
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,169
Instead of sound-on-film, the Vitaphone was
a sound-on-disc process that solved the duration

106
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:34,750
problem by recording the sound on multiple
discs.

107
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,750
Genius.

108
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,819
At first, the studios all passed on the Vitaphone.

109
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,099
They said, “No way.

110
00:04:39,099 --> 00:04:40,099
Punch.”

111
00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:41,099
Then along came Warner Brothers.

112
00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:44,410
At the time, they were just a small studio
looking to elbow their way into the big leagues.

113
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:48,199
And they decided to take a chance and be the
first film studio to make and show sync-sound

114
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,449
films on a large scale.

115
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:52,419
They leased the rights to the Vitaphone system
– as well as the right to sublease it to

116
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:55,580
other studios – and set about converting
their theaters to handle sound films.

117
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,400
Now, originally, they didn’t intend to incorporate
dialogue into the sound.

118
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,580
Their idea was simply to use it for music
and sound effects.

119
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,580
Their first effort was the 1926 film Don Juan,
a sumptuous costume drama starring John Barrymore.

120
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,599
Before the film, they played an hour of sync-sound
short films, including musical performances

121
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:13,030
and a brief spoken message from Will Hays,
president of the Motion Pictures Producers

122
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,340
and Distributors of America, welcoming the
world to the era of sound.

123
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,120
This is part of what he had to say:

124
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:30,349
“My friends, no story ever written for the
screen is as dramatic as the story of the

125
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:31,930
screen itself.”

126
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,270
People were blown away.

127
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,560
They were like, “Whaaat?

128
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
That guy’s talking!”

129
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,270
Don Juan broke box office records in city
after city.

130
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,540
Film critics lavished praise on the Vitaphone
system.

131
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,030
And a Columbia University physicist said of
the Hays speech: “No closer approach to

132
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,490
resurrection has ever been made by science.”

133
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,020
Now, this doesn’t mean that the coming of
sound worked out for everybody.

134
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,569
Until now, screen actors up had been trained
to act through gestures.

135
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:55,440
Suddenly, dialogue – not to mention your
voice and your enunciation – had real consequences.

136
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,930
And not every silent film star was able to
make the transition.

137
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,510
Buster Keaton, for instance, was known as
the Great Stoneface for the stoic expression

138
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:04,260
he wore, no matter how things were falling
apart around his character.

139
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,910
But then sound came along, and the charm of
Keaton’s deadpan silence was lost, when

140
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,270
he started to speak.

141
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,610
Kinda like when I start to speak.

142
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,539
Sound films also threatened the musicians
that played live music at movie theaters.

143
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,550
And, of course, it was still going to cost
a boatload of money to convert production

144
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,610
studios and movie theaters to sound.

145
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,270
Nevertheless, by 1927, the writing was on
the wall.

146
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,030
Sound was coming, and the major studios couldn’t
stall any longer.

147
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,990
That year, the “big three” studios – MGM,
Famous Players, and First National – adopted

148
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,470
the Vitaphone process and set about converting
their theaters.

149
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:34,120
Meanwhile, Warner Brothers had already finished
building a sound studio on their lot, and

150
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,819
producing their next film, The Jazz Singer.

151
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:39,550
The plan was to make a film with music, not
dialogue; but when star Al Jolson improvised

152
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,560
a few lines, the studio agreed to leave them
in.

153
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,420
Unlike most lines I improvise for this.

154
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,880
Jolson: Now, Mama. Mama, stop now. You're gettin' kittenish.

155
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,920
Jolson: Mama. Listen, now I'm gonna sing this like I will if I go on the stage.

156
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,320
Jolson: You know with the show. I'm gonna sing it Jazzy.

157
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,580
Jolson: Now, get this.

158
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,800
Jolson: [singing] Blue skies, smilin' at me. Me, me, me!

159
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,420
Jolson: [singing] Nothin' but, little blue skies, do I see. Doh, doh, doh doh doh!

160
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,080
And that – this incidental spoken dialogue
– really sent audiences over the top.

161
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,849
Think about it – they’d always heard music
in some form while watching a film, either

162
00:07:07,849 --> 00:07:09,639
from live musicians or a phonograph.

163
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:12,860
And they’d been spoken to, in speeches and
performances like the Hays speech or the de

164
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,860
Forest phonofilms.

165
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,870
But they’d never heard informal dialogue
spoken to other characters within the world

166
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,870
of the film!

167
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,580
Suddenly, audiences were listening in on the
story.

168
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,800
And overhearing the dialogue made the story
seem more real.

169
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,840
In some ways, sync-sound completed the “illusion
of reality” that began three decades earlier

170
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,479
with the very first motion pictures.

171
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,270
Soon, new genres emerged.

172
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,940
Musicals and dance movies were suddenly possible.

173
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:39,300
Disney led the way in feature film animation,
incorporating dialogue and songs into their

174
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,560
shorts and features.

175
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:48,380
Gangster movies and monster films became more
popular, as sound effects and music allowed

176
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,880
them to ratchet up tension.

177
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,540
Also, newspaper movies became fashionable,
as films like The Front Page and Platinum

178
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,600
Blonde had reporters trading witty banter
as they chased down stories.

179
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,749
These films eventually led to classics like
Howard Hawks’ His Girl Friday and even the

180
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:03,430
great Citizen Kane.

181
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,430
Never heard of it.

182
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,470
Old genres got a facelift too.

183
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:08,749
Comedies in particular found new ways to make
us laugh through dialogue, instead of relying

184
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:09,949
on physical humor alone.

185
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:13,189
On the technical side, the arrival of sound
changed career opportunities for women in

186
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:14,189
film as well.

187
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:15,189
And not for the better.

188
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:17,449
Prior to sound, women edited more Hollywood
films than men did.

189
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:20,289
That’s because, at the time, editing was
thought of as menial labor, the grunt work

190
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:22,710
of painstakingly splicing together bits of
film.

191
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,370
Then sound came along, and the technological
requirements of the job multiplied.

192
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:30,431
And almost overnight, film editors were responsible
for assembling not just images, but the sound

193
00:08:30,431 --> 00:08:32,289
effects, music, and dialogue as well.

194
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:34,440
Just like that, the reign of women in the
cutting room was over.

195
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,870
They saw themselves replaced by men, who were
seen as more technically minded.

196
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,390
But women editors in Hollywood did make a
comeback – from Thelma Schoonmaker, who

197
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,450
cut every Martin Scorsese film from Raging
Bull to The Wolf of Wall Street, to Lisa Lassek,

198
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,500
who edited Joss Whedon’s Avengers movies.

199
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,350
Today we talked about the engineering hurdles
and breakthroughs that led to the arrival

200
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,139
of reliable synchronous sound to cinema.

201
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:54,830
We learned how the Hollywood studios resisted
the arrival of sound films as long as they

202
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,529
could, until audience demand forced them to
give in.

203
00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:01,040
And we considered how sound film changed the
studios, the films themselves, and the lives

204
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,130
of those who made them.

205
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,930
Which sets us up perfectly for what came next:
the official Golden Age of Hollywood.

206
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,370
I’ll see you then!

207
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,370
In the pictures!

208
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:11,870
