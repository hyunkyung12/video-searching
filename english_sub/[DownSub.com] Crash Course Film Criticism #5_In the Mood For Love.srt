1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,800
The history of film is full of tragic love
stories, from Casablanca

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,370
to Brokeback Mountain, Brief Encounter, Ghost,
An Affair to Remember, Titanic, or Amour…

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,559
The list goes on and on!

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,520
Movies seem to capture that mix of yearning,
anguish, and exhilaration that comes with

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,270
falling in love so well.

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,040
Especially when that love can’t last.

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,050
And that’s because film is, at its core,
an emotional medium.

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,470
It immerses us in a world with intricate settings
and sounds.

9
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,850
And we live vicariously through characters
as their stories unfold before us.

10
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:36,620
No one can chart the complex course of the
human heart quite like the filmmaker Wong Kar-Wai.

11
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:41,020
And the film In the Mood for Love is a great
example of his skill, whether we see it as

12
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:46,440
a deep meditation on human longing, or a reflection
of the sociopolitical tensions in our world.

13
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:59,360
[intro music plays]

14
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,600
In the Mood for Love tells the story of a
doomed love affair set in 1960s Hong Kong.

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,810
It was released in 2000 and hailed an instant
classic, winning awards all over the globe,

16
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:09,820
from Cannes to Chicago.

17
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,299
But the film’s journey to the screen began
years before that.

18
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:17,420
In the mid-1990s, Wong Kar-Wai, the film’s
writer-director, was riding a wave to the

19
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,560
forefront of international cinema.

20
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,310
Films like 1990’s Days of Being Wild
and 1994’s Chunking Express put him on the

21
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,280
map as an exciting young filmmaker with a
distinctive voice.

22
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,409
He achieves that voice by working in a very
unusual way: He often goes off-script and

23
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:36,729
follows inspiration as it strikes, sometimes
changing the nature of a film in the middle

24
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:37,729
of a shoot.

25
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:41,939
As a result, many of his films end up playing
with time, repeating moments or scenes.

26
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:46,009
He’s not afraid to fragment a narrative
to illuminate deep yet simple truths about

27
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:47,439
the human experience.

28
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,749
In his book on Wong Kar-Wai, the film scholar
Stephen Teo notes that “Wong’s films are

29
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:55,030
best seen as a series of interconnecting short
stories.”

30
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,939
In the Mood for Love fits that bill.

31
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:01,609
It’s a movie made up of gestures, like closely
observed looks between characters, and moments,

32
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:05,189
like shots of people walking down the street
or racing up a flight of stairs.

33
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:07,960
Individually, the shots are gorgeous and atmospheric.

34
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,710
Collectively, they take on new meaning and
depth, and build a portrait of intense longing.

35
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,270
The film’s story came together slowly over
many years.

36
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,300
At one point it was going to be a sequel to
his breakout film, Days of Being Wild.

37
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,470
Later, it would be a romance called Springtime
in Beijing.

38
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,220
Wong Kar-Wai even started shooting some of
the movie under the title Secrets at the same

39
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,500
time he was making Happy Together in Hong
Kong.

40
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,840
Eventually, he found inspiration in a novella
by Liu Yi-chang called

41
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,470
“Dui Dao,” or “Intersection.”

42
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,970
True to its title, this vaguely stream-of-consciousness
work follows the interior monologues of two

43
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,370
characters whose paths keep crossing in the
streets of Hong Kong.

44
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,840
And, from this spark, he created the film
In the Mood for Love as we know it today.

45
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,460
Tony Leung plays Mr. Chow, a married man who
rents a room in one of Hong Kong’s famously

46
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,950
overcrowded apartment buildings.

47
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,300
Mrs. Chan, played by Maggie Cheung, and her
husband rent the room next door.

48
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,340
Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan often find themselves
home alone, their spouses off traveling for

49
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,660
business or working late.

50
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:07,640
In fact, their spouses are so absent from
the film that the movie never shows us their faces!

51
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,360
Eventually, Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan discover
that their spouses are having an affair.

52
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,960
So our heroes embark on an affair of their
own.

53
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,960
Sort of.

54
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,690
Rather than jumping into each other’s arms
or beds, they skirt the edges of an actual

55
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,150
romantic relationship.

56
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,540
They “play-act” the roles of each other’s
spouses.

57
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,080
And they improvise ways that affair might
have started.

58
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,120
When they go to dinner, Mrs. Chan orders Mr.
Chow the steak she imagines her husband would

59
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,120
have had.

60
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,620
And Mr. Chow orders her a spicy dish his wife
would enjoy.

61
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,700
Later, they act out an imagined confrontation
between Mrs. Chan and her husband, where she

62
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,520
accuses him of having a mistress.

63
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,480
Mrs. Chan: I didn't expect it to hurt that much.

64
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,040
Mr. Chow: This is just a rehearsal.

65
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,460
And finally, in an emotionally brutal scene,
they rehearse the end of their own affair.

66
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,480
It leaves Mrs. Chan devastated, as make-believe
hits too close to home.

67
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,310
Throughout their relationship, they collaborate
on a serialized story Mr. Chow is writing

68
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,960
and spend a single night together in a hotel.

69
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,980
What they do that night is left a mystery.

70
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,660
And while it’s clear to us that these two
are falling in love, they keep denying it

71
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:18,690
to themselves, even as their ambitions and
fears become more intertwined.

72
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,260
In the end, their love can’t survive, and
they go their separate ways.

73
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,980
A devastating coda shows them just missing
each other over the years, and eventually

74
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,600
makes it clear that their affair will never
be rekindled.

75
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,580
On its surface, In the Mood for Love is a
straightforward story of repressed love.

76
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:38,730
And, as with most Wong Kar-Wai films, it’s
meticulously designed, arranged, and shot.

77
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:43,280
Wong is a known fan of film noir and melodramas
from Hollywood’s Golden Age, like Douglas

78
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,790
Sirk’s All that Heaven Allows.

79
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:49,960
And he saturates this film with dark urban
streets, deep shadows, and almost lurid reds

80
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,380
and blue-greens – the colors of passion,
guilt, and jealousy.

81
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,070
Wong has often cited Alfred Hitchcock’s
Vertigo as a chief inspiration for In the

82
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,070
Mood for Love.

83
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,760
It’s another film drenched in color, built
on suspense, in which characters play-act

84
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,760
a relationship.

85
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:07,150
In this film, the camera embraces the central
affair in ways the characters never do.

86
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,510
It slides back and forth between them at dinner.

87
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,790
It tracks them in slow motion through the
street.

88
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:16,040
And it observes them thinking alone, their
faces betraying none of the emotions roiling

89
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,040
under the surface.

90
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,010
Instead, those emotions spill forth through
those brilliant colors and a lush romantic

91
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:25,470
soundtrack that spans Japanese and Chinese
period pop songs and Spanish-language ballads

92
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:26,930
sung by Nat King Cole.

93
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:30,750
Time and again, Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan are
photographed through other objects – like

94
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,290
doorways, windows, furniture, or mirrors – as
though they’re being watched.

95
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,260
Because, of course, they are.

96
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,260
By us.

97
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:41,150
As wonderfully designed and shot this film
is, its real power is revealed in how the

98
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,980
characters act out their spouses’ affair
with each other.

99
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:48,580
In “Film & History: An Interdisciplinary
Journal,” Humanities scholar Tony Hughes-d’Aeth

100
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,210
looks at the film through a Freudian lens.

101
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,740
By reading the story this way, you can see
how the same fatal flaw that has doomed their

102
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,870
real marriages dooms their fantasy affair
too.

103
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:01,800
Hughes-d’Aeth writes: “Both Mr. Chow and
Mrs. Chan are, beneath their suave mannerisms,

104
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,390
paralyzed by a single, devastating idea: I
am not enough for the other.”

105
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:10,040
So the movie could be a deep examination of
tragedy, of two people who can’t escape

106
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,669
the sense of insufficiency they feel toward
their spouses, even when they have the chance

107
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:15,160
to start over with someone new.

108
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,260
In this reading of the film, the romanticism
of the design, camerawork, and soundtrack

109
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,600
are in sharp contrast to the characters’
inability to accept that romance in their lives.

110
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,460
In other words, the mood is set, and the love
may be real, but Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan can’t

111
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,210
bring themselves to act on it.

112
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:35,180
In the end, they keep missing each other – first
in Singapore, and then back in Hong Kong.

113
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,280
And this reading suggests that this is because
they’re more comfortable loving the imagined

114
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,070
versions of each other, rather than the real
people.

115
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,100
Basically, the fantasy is what’s driving
their affair.

116
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,360
And as much as In the Mood for Love zeroes
in on Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan’s story, another

117
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,310
way to look at this movie is to examine how
their relationship is a prism that reflects

118
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,520
the geo-politics of Hong Kong at the time.

119
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,280
The film is explicitly set in Hong Kong between
1962 and 1966, a pivotal time in the history

120
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,280
of the territory.

121
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,070
And even though the politics of the era take
place entirely in the background of the film,

122
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,630
some critics argue that they’re key to fully
understanding it.

123
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:13,070
The film begins in 1962, a period of relative
stability in the region.

124
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:17,380
At the time, Hong Kong was a British colony
and a waypoint for emigrants leaving the economic

125
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,610
and political uncertainty of mainland China
for other countries.

126
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:24,490
And those who settled permanently in Hong
Kong found themselves in an unusual place

127
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:27,690
– one where east met west and communism
met capitalism.

128
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:31,610
The music and film studies scholar Giorgio
Biancorosso described Hong Kong at the time

129
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:36,300
as: “a political, social, and cultural space
that has become distinctly local, a space

130
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,270
defined both by the immigrant’s desire of
starting from scratch and the islander’s

131
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,340
sense of being separate.”

132
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,380
This idea of being stuck between two worlds
also drives the central conflict of In the

133
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,380
Mood for Love.

134
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:50,080
Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan find themselves caught
between their own failed marriages, their

135
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,020
desire for each other, and their allegiance
to the restrictive social codes of the time

136
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,020
and place.

137
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:59,230
When the film jumps to 1966, not only has
their love affair become deeply broken, but

138
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:02,280
the political realities of Hong Kong have
become chaotic too.

139
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,700
1966 was the start of the Chinese Cultural
Revolution, a violent class struggle that

140
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,480
gripped mainland China for the next decade.

141
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,560
Now, in 1966 in the world of the film, Mrs.
Chan returns to Hong Kong.

142
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:17,010
She visits her former landlady, who essentially
set Mrs. Chan’s affair in motion.

143
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:20,610
Her former landlady says she’s leaving Hong
Kong for the United States because of the

144
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:21,790
political instability.

145
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:25,940
So just as the safe harbor of Hong Kong is
going through major changes, the space that

146
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:30,060
first incubated the love between Mrs. Chan
and Mr. Chow is coming to an end.

147
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:35,759
That sense of uncertainty and of lost possibilities
infuses the film from its first carefully-crafted

148
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:37,380
frame to its last.

149
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,669
So whatever lens you use to analyze In the
Mood for Love, the film holds up.

150
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:45,999
It’s both a technical achievement and a
poetic examination of two people who fall

151
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:50,939
deeply in love but are unwilling or unable
to accept happiness together.

152
00:08:50,939 --> 00:08:53,040
Which is, ultimately, kind of haunting.

153
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,380
Next time, we’ll trade the restrained longing
of 1960s Hong Kong for the raucous, scorching,

154
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,550
hip-hop-infused Brooklyn of Spike Lee’s
Do the Right Thing.

155
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:05,990
Crash Course Film Production is produced in
association with PBS Digital Studios.
