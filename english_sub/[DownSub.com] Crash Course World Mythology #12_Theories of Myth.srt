1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,000
Hey there, I'm Mike Rugnetta

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,000
This is Crash Course mythology,

3
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,580
and in the first episode of this series,

4
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,440
we defined what we mean by myth.

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,520
I also said that we weren't gonna get too theoretical

6
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,120
because the theory of mythology gets complicated quickly--

7
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,300
but you all have <i>asked</i> for an episode on theories of mythology;

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,680
...and if you know me, and the other things that I make,

9
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,620
you know how I feel.. about talking theory.

10
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,940
So... that's what we're gonna do;

11
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,000
and, ok, that ask may have just been some strong-arming from Thoth,

12
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,360
but who can say no to that face?!?

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,500
[intro music]

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,040
So.. let's look at how people think about mythology

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,240
and give you some ideas about how to analyze

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,660
myths yourself.

17
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,460
We're gonna start with the definition of

18
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,440
MYTH - OLOGY

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,800
Unlike myths themselves, which as we pointed out

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,920
are difficult to define, mythology

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,320
is pretty straightforward--

22
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,300
since in english, "ology" means basically the study of--

23
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,320
"mythology" is the systematic study of myths...

24
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,360
...a thing you probably already figured out for yourself

25
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,960
at this point in the series.

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,140
The real question is..

27
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,620
HOW are myths studied,

28
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,060
and for that we're gonna jump in our time-machine

29
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,320
--courtesy of Zurvan the zoroastrian god of time--

30
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,400
check your divine flux capacitor and buckle up.

31
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,700
So, we start in ancient Greece. In the first episode

32
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:20,300
I mentioned that critical analysis of myths has been around for a long time.

33
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,240
As early as the mid 500's BCE

34
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,180
presocratic philosophers like Xenophanes were criticizing Hesiod and Homer

35
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,360
for attributing all of the evil and shameful aspects of humanity to the gods.

36
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:36,260
Plato was among the first to equate myths with 'lying'

37
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,680
and, as we discussed in episode 1, that idea has stuck.

38
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,200
But Plato further complicated this issue because he claimed that myths about

39
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,640
gods, heroes, and fantastic creatures were irrational and therefore, 'false.'

40
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,660
Yet philosophical myths like the ones he put forward in "The Republic"

41
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,320
served a rational purpose.. and were 'true.'

42
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,340
Sorry Thoth, you're gonna have to talk it over with Veritas, Roman goddess of truth.

43
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,400
A little bit after Plato came the influential thinker Euhemeros.

44
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,300
He assumed that people who lived before him were primitive, with no concept of science,

45
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:13,500
so they created fanciful versions of historical events to explain things they didn't understand.

46
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:19,060
In Euhemeros's opinion, Zeus was an early human king whose deeds became legendary and,

47
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,300
as those legends were retold, he transformed into a god.

48
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,500
Euhemerism has come to mean interpreting "Myths as primitive explanations of the natural world

49
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:34,000
or as time-distorted accounts of long-past historical events."

50
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:41,020
Although Euhemeros wasn't particularly influential in his own time, his ideas were picked up later by Roman thinkers--

51
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,120
--especially Christians.

52
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:48,220
Early church-thinkers, like Tertullian and Clement of Alexanderia, took up the Platonic sense of myth as 'falsehood',

53
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:54,020
and upon it they based a new theory: that the Greek and Roman myths were influenced by demons

54
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:59,580
who wanted the stories to prepare their listeners for the story of Jesus, and to provide a contrast between him

55
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,700
and the pagan gods.

56
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,460
..so, I mean, those are some pretty helpful demons.. I guess?

57
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:10,480
These early mythologists set up a dichotomy between 'mythos,' associated with falsehood,

58
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,300
and 'logos,' which Christian thinkers associated with transcendant truth.

59
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:20,500
This synthesis of Plato and Christianity was the basis of Western mythology until the Renaissance.

60
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:26,740
For many centuries European artists drew a great deal from classical Greek and Roman myths

61
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,000
but, mythology as a study didn't really take off until the 18th and 19th centuries,

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,560
drawing on the linguistic discovery that the languages of India, SouthWest-Asia and Europe are all related--

63
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,740
they're all derived from a single language,

64
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,040
now known as "Proto-Indo-Europian".

65
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,560
The discovery of Proto-Indo-Europian led some to posit that it was spoken by a group called "Aryans,"

66
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,220
whose myths were the basis for all European, Indian, and Southwest-Asian myths--

67
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,400
--a purported explanation for their similarities.

68
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:03,160
In addition to the Aryan hypothesis, this discovery also gave way to a broadly comparative mythology

69
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,100
that focused much more on origin and content than function.

70
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,200
There's no real evidence that these Aryans ever existed,

71
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,700
but that didn't stop romantic thinkers like Johann Gottfried Herder

72
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:20,779
who believed that their myths, along with other things, embodied the simplicity and purity of the German 'volk.'

73
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:26,440
That sounds innocuous enough until we learn that the Nazis would later appropriate Herders pro-German ideas

74
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,780
to justify their atrocities and legitimize their hateful ideology.

75
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:36,760
The study of myth changes again in the 20th century when it joins forces with the new discipline of anthropology.

76
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:42,720
Anthropologists wouldn't just read about myths in libraries, they would conduct fieldwork

77
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,000
to discover how myths functioned in living societies.

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,040
Although in the early days of anthropology the object of study was still societies considered 'primitive,'

79
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,980
...at least by those anthropologists.

80
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,260
Let's go to the thought bubble--

81
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,720
One of the towering figures in this new way of studying myths was the Scottish anthropologist Sir James Frazer

82
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,640
who could really rock a beard.

83
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,360
His twelve volume book, "The Golden Bough,"

84
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,200
centers on different versions of a myth in which sacred kings are slaughtered

85
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,600
in order to ensure a bountiful harvest.

86
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,200
Frazer supported the concepts of myths as primitive science,

87
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,620
which attributed to the will of deities, people or animals

88
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,000
that which modern science attributes to the impersonal functioning of

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,900
various physical laws and biological processes.

90
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,780
That's another way of saying, "Hey, if you haven't quite mastered physics, blame a god."

91
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,900
To be honest, that's what I do.

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,200
Ooooh! A GOD!

93
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,200
One of the mythologists to follow Frazer,

94
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,600
BronisÅ‚aw Malinowski, did fieldwork in the Trobriand Islands

95
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,000
and outlined the new anthropological view of myth that grew out of working with living peoples.

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Studied alive, myth... is not symbolic, but a direct expression of its subject-matter;

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
... a narrative resurrection of a primeval reality,

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
... Myth fulfills in primitive culture an indispensable function;

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,500
it expresses, enhances and codifies belief;

100
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,000
it safeguards and enforces morality;

101
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,500
it vouches for the efficiency of ritual

102
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,500
and contains practical rules for the guidance of man.

103
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,000
Yeah, that 'primitive peoples' part is a little hard to take. Early anthropology was pretty judgy.

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But this new approach had the advantage of

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,500
focusing on what so-called primitive people know,

106
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,000
rather than what they don't.

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Building on the work of anthropologists, recent mythologists

108
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
have tried to connect their work to the lived experiences of actual human beings.

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,220
--Thanks, Thought Bubble!

110
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,000
At around the same time that anthropology was gaining prominence,

111
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
the new field of psychology was also looking to myths

112
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,360
for an explanation of human experience.

113
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,500
Two of the best known psychologists,

114
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,500
Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung,

115
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,000
posit that the source of myths is the human unconscious,

116
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,700
and that mythical characters are projections of that unconscious.

117
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,060
We're gonna return to these thinkers in a later episode,

118
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,540
but for now it's helpful to understand the fundamental difference between the two.

119
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,720
For Freud, the unconscious is the true psychical reality;

120
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,200
but our conscious minds, like Tom Cruise,

121
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,160
"CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!!"

122
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:12,440
So we make these terrible realities palatable, by creating imaginative works,

123
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,140
like myths,

124
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:19,480
which are strategies for managing the internal forces that shape our thoughts, feelings and actions.

125
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,520
Jung similarly saw myths as a projection of the unconscious,

126
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,740
but for him.. the unconscious was collective and universal

127
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,520
--NOT individual.

128
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,500
It's like a reservoir, from which we all drink.

129
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,740
A reservoir with more dreams... and less flouride

130
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,160
They put that in the reservoir itself, right?

131
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,200
Jung defined a number of archetypes that he saw as aspects of every person's psyche

132
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,200
and, in his estimation, the characters that appear in myths

133
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,800
are versions of these archetypes.

134
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,200
The collective nature of human consciousness

135
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,000
may be one reason we can find similar mythic characters

136
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,800
from stories originating in many parts of the world.

137
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,200
And of course, we couldn't do an episode on thoeries of mythology

138
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,200
without mentioning the best known mythologist of the twentieth century,

139
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,200
Lets hear it for: Joseph Campbell.

140
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,200
Campbell became famous in the 1980s for a television series,

141
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,600
"The Power of Myth," also with Bill Moyers.

142
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,000
And George Lucas also credited Campbell with influencing Star Wars.

143
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,800
Luke, guess... he's your father.

144
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,000
More on that later.

145
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,800
Campbell's understanding of myth, and particularly of hero stories,

146
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,000
is a reflection of the American valorization of rugged individuals.

147
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,200
For Campbell, "Mythology is ultimately and always

148
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,600
the vehicle through which the individual

149
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,600
finds a sense of identity and place in the world."

150
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,799
Campbell synthesized the ideas of psychoanalysts,

151
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,799
comparative mythologists, and literary and cultural critics

152
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,499
to create his own theory of a single "mono-myth"

153
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,500
that underlies all mythical stories.

154
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,700
Meanwhile, French anthropologist, Claude Levi-Strauss

155
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,200
-- no relationship to the blue-jeans --

156
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,000
developed a theory for describing myths by looking at their structure.

157
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,800
Structuralism holds that specific instances of culture,

158
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,360
like myths, betray a much more complicated underlying structure.

159
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,800
What that structure is, and how it works,

160
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,000
depends upon which structuralist you're talking to.

161
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,700
Levi-Strauss, arguably the first structuralist, was all about...

162
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,800
BINARIES.

163
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,800
Culture is built a relationship between..

164
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,000
male and female,

165
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,800
hero and villain,

166
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,000
even cooked and raw, among many others.

167
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,200
For him, myths, like all units of culture,

168
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,600
sit atop these inescapable opposing binaries.

169
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,200
And, since many students of mythology will have heard of him and his theories,

170
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,000
we should also mention Romanian religious historian,

171
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,200
Mircea Eliade.

172
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,000
Even though his personal politics have overshadowed his scholarship in many circles.

173
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,800
Eliade was a Romanian nationalist who associated with a proto-fascist group

174
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,200
and thus his reputation, like that of Herder and Nietzsche, has suffered.

175
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,000
Hey!

176
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Mythologists!

177
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,800
No more chillin' with fascists, ok?

178
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,500
I feel like I shouldn't even have to ask this.

179
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,500
Eliade was also a fan of binaries;

180
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,200
particularly the sacred and the profane,

181
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,800
as well as the archaic and the modern.

182
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,800
For Eliade, archaic people were more in-touch with the sacred.

183
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,500
And today myths allow us to escape the profane,

184
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,000
to travel back to the past,

185
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
and re-encounter the sacred.

186
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,500
Structuralist theory was very popular at the end of the twentieth century,

187
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,800
but it also left a lot of people wondering, "so what?"

188
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,600
What do we gain by reducing all myths to a set of patterns,

189
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
or even to one single pattern?

190
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,000
What does that really tell us about-

191
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,800
-why cultures use myth, or how myth reveals culture?

192
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,000
Contemporary approaches have pioneered some new methods

193
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
of asking and answering these questions.

194
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,200
William Doty proposes giving students of myth a toolkit

195
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,800
which includes a series of questions to ask when reading myths,

196
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,000
centering on several concerns:

197
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,800
the social,

198
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,800
the psychological,

199
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,500
the literary,

200
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,500
textual and performative,

201
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,200
the structural and, finally, the political.

202
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,200
These provide a broader way of looking at myths.

203
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,800
Wendy Doniger provides an updated version of comparative mythology,

204
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,000
asking myth readers to look also at the context in which the myth is told--

205
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,800
exploring difference.

206
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,500
These more contemporary ways of looking at myths

207
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,800
fit well with the complex view of the world that we try to take here at Crash Course.

208
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,200
but, we're not going to follow any one school of thought

209
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,200
when it comes to how we "-ology" these here "myths".

210
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,000
We like being eclectic,

211
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,200
and have no interest in forcing you to see myths in one particular way.

212
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,600
HadÃºr, Hungarian god of forests?

213
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,000
Got my eye on you!

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000

Thanks for watching and, you know what?

227
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,800
I've been thinking about it, I think I'm going to come clean:

228
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,200
I don't feel great about that Star Wars joke earlier.

229
00:12:10,200 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm real sorry.
