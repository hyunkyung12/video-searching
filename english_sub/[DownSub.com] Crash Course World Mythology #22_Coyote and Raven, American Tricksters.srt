00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,045
Hi, I'm Mike Rugnetta, this is Crash Course Mythology, and today

2
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:05,515
we're finishing up our series on trickster stories

3
00:00:05,515 --> 00:00:08,715
by looking at two of the most famous and popular

4
00:00:08,715 --> 00:00:10,955
tricksters of them all, coyote and

5
00:00:10,955 --> 00:00:13,835
raven. There are many individual Native American

6
00:00:13,835 --> 00:00:16,505
mythological traditions from different tribes

7
00:00:16,505 --> 00:00:19,065
and in different regions and stories about

8
00:00:19,065 --> 00:00:21,995
coyotes and ravens as grand tricksters

9
00:00:21,995 --> 00:00:24,935
pop up in tales across the whole continent.

10
00:00:25,045 --> 00:00:27,585
In many locations these animals would have been known for making

11
00:00:27,585 --> 00:00:28,085
 

12
00:00:28,085 --> 00:00:30,515
off with livestock, or picking at the bodies of dead

13
00:00:30,515 --> 00:00:31,015
 

14
00:00:31,015 --> 00:00:34,075
animals. While scavenging isn't exactly clever in the way

15
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:36,545
tricksters often are it is sort of...

16
00:00:36,795 --> 00:00:39,735
devious, which explains the wealth of trickster myths

17
00:00:39,735 --> 00:00:43,005
about these two figures. We're gonna focus on a few

18
00:00:43,175 --> 00:00:46,305
of the best of them. And along the way we'll see that sometimes playing a few tricks

19
00:00:46,305 --> 00:00:49,175
can really put a twinkle in your eye. Or,

20
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,420
make it pink.

21
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:57,000
[theme music]

22
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,535
 

23
00:01:00,535 --> 00:01:02,100
Before I get into the specific myths,

24
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,065
I should explain something

25
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:06,115
about the content and context of some of these

26
00:01:06,115 --> 00:01:09,145
coyote and raven stories. We've already mentioned that

27
00:01:09,145 --> 00:01:12,445
in many Native American myths, the line between the human world

28
00:01:12,445 --> 00:01:15,220
and animal world is blurry. Humans live alongside

29
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,580
mythological animals that help create the world

30
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,600
and establish important rituals.

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,660
This handling of mythological animals

32
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,160
is distinct from say,

33
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,500
the pantheon of gods and monsters that we see

34
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,340
in Norse, Greek, or egyptian traditions.

35
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,260
Those traditions have myths about animals, it's true.

36
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,220
But they aren't the stars of the show, in the way

37
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,400
that they are in Native American myths

38
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,700
I also just want to say, up front that the myths we're about to discuss

39
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,540
aren't exactly...

40
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:42,780
G-rated.

41
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,060
Some scholars have pointed out that many Native American  myths

42
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,620
feature particularly frank discussions of Sexy-Time

43
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,640
and the organs that are used to accomplish it.

44
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,460
Thoth, buddy. There's no need to blush.

45
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,420
and also they talk a lot about the elimination of...

46
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,220
bodily wastes.

47
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,860
so long story short we're going to talk about poop

48
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:04,860
One day, Coyote is out walking and he sees some tasty looking, bright red rose-hips

49
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,295
He's about to gobble them up

50
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,280
when those rose-hips, that can talk, bt - dubbs,

51
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,899
worn Coyote that, if gobbled

52
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,400
they're gonna' give him horrible flatulence

53
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,960
But Coyote doesn't listen so

54
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,080
CHOMP

55
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,520
And wouldn't you know it, soon Coyote is stumbling around

56
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,640
doubled over in pain from a rather intense and alarming build-up of gas.

57
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,820
At about this time, Coyote happens across two crows picking over

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,015
a dead buffalo. Devising a plan, Coyote

59
00:02:30,015 --> 00:02:33,135
asks if they want to play a game. Which,

60
00:02:33,135 --> 00:02:35,885
I mean of course they do! Who doesn't love a game?!

61
00:02:35,885 --> 00:02:38,305
Coyote proposes a contest to see

62
00:02:38,755 --> 00:02:40,300
who can defecate

63
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,605
from one side of the buffalo to the other. Whoever is able to launch their poop

64
00:02:44,605 --> 00:02:47,415
over the buffalo, gets to keep it

65
00:02:47,415 --> 00:02:50,275
and eat it. The buffalo, I mean, not the poop.

66
00:02:50,275 --> 00:02:52,395
I'm not sure who get's that - anyway, the crows

67
00:02:52,785 --> 00:02:55,695
think that this is disgusting, and hey, samesies.

68
00:02:55,695 --> 00:02:58,255
But Coyote is very persuasive

69
00:02:58,385 --> 00:03:01,415
and the contest begins. The crow goes first.

70
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:04,235
He turns around and he poops as hard as he can,

71
00:03:04,235 --> 00:03:07,075
but only manages to "poop - shoot" halfway.

72
00:03:07,185 --> 00:03:10,235
Coyote, now fit to BURST

73
00:03:10,235 --> 00:03:12,700
with rose hip's gas, turns around,

74
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,195
relaxes, and let's just

75
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,055
say, he wins the contest - easily.

76
00:03:18,055 --> 00:03:20,925
The crows cannot believe their eyes.

77
00:03:20,925 --> 00:03:23,925
They beg Coyote to let them have SOME

78
00:03:23,925 --> 00:03:26,915
of the buffalo meat. In an uncharacteristic bit of trickster compassion,

79
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,000
Coyote is no Anansi,

80
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,875
He agrees to give them the fat around the eye sockets and the joints

81
00:03:33,155 --> 00:03:34,605
and the ribs,

82
00:03:35,555 --> 00:03:36,555
*weird groan*

83
00:03:36,845 --> 00:03:39,000
Stan, maybe cancel my lunch order?

84
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,255
OK, according to Lenard McClure, the moral of the story is

85
00:03:51,195 --> 00:03:53,000
I might say the moral is also don't eat

86
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,055
rose hips, don't poop competitively, but maybe even with gastrointestinal

87
00:03:57,055 --> 00:04:00,600
crisis, there can be found... great opportunity?

88
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,400
At least, if you have your tricky cap on?

89
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,825
Aww, Thoth, is that your tricky cap?

90
00:04:04,825 --> 00:04:07,545
Looks good. This story also shows an important similarity

91
00:04:07,545 --> 00:04:10,805
Coyote shares with the tricksters of other mythological traditions.

92
00:04:10,805 --> 00:04:13,895
He is unable to resist giving in to his outside

93
00:04:13,895 --> 00:04:16,795
hedonistic desires. Remember hungry Hermes

94
00:04:16,795 --> 00:04:19,725
and greedy Anansi? The entire poop

95
00:04:19,725 --> 00:04:22,685
shot-put is a result of Coyote munching

96
00:04:22,685 --> 00:04:25,685
down on tasty looking rose hips even though

97
00:04:25,685 --> 00:04:28,665
he knows it's a bad idea. Not all of Coyote's desires are

98
00:04:28,665 --> 00:04:31,000
quite so... digestion oriented, of course.

99
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,695
There are a number of stories that involve his sexual appetites.

100
00:04:34,695 --> 00:04:37,605
And in many Native American stories, the trickster's desire for

101
00:04:37,605 --> 00:04:40,775
sex is interpreted as a mirror for the rest of

102
00:04:40,775 --> 00:04:43,625
humanity. A recognition that most of us have

103
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,305
similar drives. As our old friends Lenard and McClure

104
00:04:46,305 --> 00:04:49,355
put it, "...The Native American's

105
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:52,355
trickster reminds us like no other that humans, for all their pretensions

106
00:04:52,355 --> 00:04:55,075
to intellectual and spiritual culture and for

107
00:04:55,155 --> 00:04:57,885
all their moments of bravery, altruism, and generosity,

108
00:04:57,885 --> 00:05:00,955
are nevertheless animals ruled by appetites

109
00:05:00,955 --> 00:05:03,285
and impulses that make them

110
00:05:03,285 --> 00:05:06,445
equally capable of cowardice, selfishness, and cruelty."

111
00:05:06,485 --> 00:05:09,175
We're not gonna' focus on

112
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:12,075
those "sexy" stories, though,

113
00:05:12,075 --> 00:05:13,525
this is a family friendly series

114
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,715
Well, except for all the death...

115
00:05:16,535 --> 00:05:19,535
and the incest, oh, and the castration,

116
00:05:19,535 --> 00:05:22,545
OK - you know what? Let's just move on. Coyote like other tricksters is

117
00:05:22,545 --> 00:05:25,265
creative, and on occasion, even helpful.

118
00:05:25,265 --> 00:05:27,865
In one story, from the Wasco people of the Pacific Northwest,

119
00:05:27,865 --> 00:05:31,255
Coyote even helps place stars in the sky.

120
00:05:31,645 --> 00:05:34,675
Let's go to the Thought Bubble. One day, Coyote sees

121
00:05:34,675 --> 00:05:37,615
several of his wolf buddies looking up at the sky.

122
00:05:37,615 --> 00:05:40,675
He asks what their looking at. "Nothing," they tell him.

123
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:43,475
The next night, they see him looking up at the sky again and asks again

124
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:46,145
Finally, the youngest wolf says," ah

125
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:49,375
Let's tell 'em, he won't do anything,"

126
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:52,000
which, I mean, had they not met Coyote?

127
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,355
the wolves tell him they are watching two mysterious animals

128
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,400
up in the sky. Ever curious, Coyote suggests,

129
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,165
" Let's go hang out with them." Coyote starts shooting arrows

130
00:06:01,165 --> 00:06:04,185
in to the sky and his aim is so good that

131
00:06:04,185 --> 00:06:07,245
each arrow hits the last one, creating a ladder of

132
00:06:07,245 --> 00:06:10,445
ladder of arrows from earth to sky. Coyote and the wolves

133
00:06:10,445 --> 00:06:13,135
climb up the arrow ladder which takes many

134
00:06:13,135 --> 00:06:16,145
days and nights, but when they finally reach their

135
00:06:16,145 --> 00:06:18,605
destination, they find that the two animals

136
00:06:18,605 --> 00:06:19,105
 

137
00:06:19,105 --> 00:06:21,960
are grizzly bears. Coyote warns the wolves

138
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,960
to not go near the bears but the two youngest wolves

139
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,860
walk over and sit down. Then, the two

140
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,835
next youngest wolves do the same. Finally, seeing

141
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,840
that it's safe, the oldest wolf goes over, and takes

142
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,955
a seat. I guess sky bears are pretty chill! Admiring

143
00:06:36,955 --> 00:06:39,275
the wolves and the bears, Coyote says

144
00:06:40,035 --> 00:06:42,685
 

145
00:06:42,685 --> 00:06:45,715
 

146
00:06:45,715 --> 00:06:48,465
 

147
00:06:48,465 --> 00:06:51,000
 

148
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,575
So Coyote leaves, taking the arrows with him

149
00:06:54,575 --> 00:06:57,565
as he returns to earth. And from there, he admires

150
00:06:57,565 --> 00:07:00,615
his handiwork, which you can still see today.

151
00:07:00,615 --> 00:07:03,045
Four wolves, make up the handle of the Big Dipper

152
00:07:03,045 --> 00:07:05,500
the youngest two wolves and the bears

153
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,900
make up its bowl. So I guess Coyote was right! Here we are

154
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,720
telling his story. Thanks ThoughtBubble

155
00:07:11,725 --> 00:07:14,960
this story is a great example of the trickster as

156
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:18,115
creator. The wolves, were probably pretty

157
00:07:18,115 --> 00:07:21,445
unhappy about being stranded in the sky with bears, but

158
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:24,455
people sure do love constellations

159
00:07:24,455 --> 00:07:26,455
In this story there's also something we haven't really

160
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,720
discussed about tricksters, or myths generally

161
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,880
the desire to be remembered.

162
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,335
Coyote leaves no doubt, when he finishes stranding those wolves

163
00:07:35,335 --> 00:07:38,555
he calls to Meadowlark and says

164
00:07:38,635 --> 00:07:41,445
 

165
00:07:41,445 --> 00:07:44,365
 

166
00:07:44,365 --> 00:07:46,935
 

167
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,760
 

168
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,180
Here at Crash Course we define myths as stories

169
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,105
that persist through time. In our forthcoming

170
00:07:55,105 --> 00:07:57,445
episodes about heroes, we'll see that the desire

171
00:07:57,445 --> 00:08:00,465
for fame; to be remembered through timeless

172
00:08:00,465 --> 00:08:02,945
tales, often motivates

173
00:08:02,945 --> 00:08:06,005
heroic deeds. We could tell stories about Coyote

174
00:08:06,005 --> 00:08:09,085
all day, but there's another famous trickster in Native American myths:

175
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,155
Raven. No, not that Raven,

176
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,720
not that one either, come on you gu- yeah. That one, bingo, you got it.

177
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,080
Raven's stories are common with the Native American Peoples of the Pacific North-West,

178
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,075
including Canada and Alaska.

179
00:08:21,075 --> 00:08:23,995
This one was recorded in English at Sitka, a

180
00:08:23,995 --> 00:08:26,945
small city in Alaska, and it starts like so. Have you ever

181
00:08:26,945 --> 00:08:29,905
wondered why ravens are black?

182
00:08:30,445 --> 00:08:33,375
A very long time ago, Raven, the trickster, was

183
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:36,455
actually stark white. And one day,

184
00:08:36,455 --> 00:08:39,375
he's journeying to visit his brother-in-law, Petrel

185
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:42,424
the sea-bird who has an everlasting spring

186
00:08:42,424 --> 00:08:45,355
of water. At the time, there wasn't any

187
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,940
water to drink, because Petrel kept his spring for himself

188
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,280
and he wouldn't share it. So Raven comes to Petrel, and

189
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,960
he tells him about all of the marvelous things that

190
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,860
he's seen throughout the world, trying to get Petrel to leave

191
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:00,300
his home so that Raven can steal some of his water.

192
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,920
But Petrel doesn't trust Raven

193
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,500
which is maybe a good call, and he won't budge.

194
00:09:05,505 --> 00:09:08,545
When the night falls, Raven and Petrel go to bed. Once

195
00:09:08,545 --> 00:09:11,855
is sure Petrel is asleep, he creeps outside

196
00:09:11,855 --> 00:09:14,985
and finds some dog poo. Yeah, it's gonna be that kind of story.

197
00:09:14,985 --> 00:09:17,915
He sneaks back in and he spreads the poo

198
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,080
all over Petrel's clothing. And the next morning Raven wakes

199
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,035
Petrel up by crying, "Wake up! Wake up brother-in-law,

200
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,720
look what you've done to your clothes!"

201
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,320
and just real quick aside here: i wanna point out that we're super unsure about

202
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,380
what "bird clothes" are. Pants? a Dicky maybe?

203
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,060
wait

204
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,980
are these birds with arms? Anyway, Petrel goes outside to clean himself up,

205
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,480
and Raven goes over to the spring, uncovers it,

206
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,320
and begins to drink. Just as Raven has slurped up

207
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,120
almost all of the water, Petrel returns

208
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,945
realises he's been tricked, and angrily chases

209
00:09:50,945 --> 00:09:54,015
Raven away. Raven flies through the smoke-hole

210
00:09:54,015 --> 00:09:56,835
in Petrel's house with the water in his mouth, and Petrel calls

211
00:09:56,835 --> 00:09:59,875
out to his spirits to catch him.

212
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:02,935
As Raven is caught by the spirits, Petrel throws pitchwood

213
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,495
onto his fire to make the smoke

214
00:10:05,495 --> 00:10:08,305
turn black.While Raven struggles

215
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,340
to get away, the black smoke soaks into his

216
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,040
feathers, and I bet you can see where this is headed.

217
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,440
Now turned black, Raven struggles free without spilling

218
00:10:17,445 --> 00:10:20,205
a single drop of water. But as he's flying

219
00:10:20,205 --> 00:10:23,475
he tries to brush off some of the char and spills

220
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,940
some water over Nass, making up the Nass river.

221
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,540
He keeps flying and keeps fidgeting and keeps spilling water

222
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,820
over Stikine, Taku, Chilkat, and all the other rivers

223
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,460
even the small drops become creeks

224
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,060
 

225
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,995
So after just one poo-stained trick,

226
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,525
the world now has water, and Raven

227
00:10:43,525 --> 00:10:46,180
has the pitch-black feathers that we know today.

228
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,680
As you can see, Raven and Coyote definitely spend their time

229
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,840
getting up to no good. Sometimes their tricks are premeditated,

230
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,320
but other times it's a matter of circumstance, often

231
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,675
poop related circumstance. And this reminds us that just because

232
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,380
you're powerful, supernatural even,

233
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,820
that doesn't mean you can escape being an animal,

234
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,320
with all the confusion, and danger, and bodily functions

235
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,760
that that entails. This sort of thing reiterates the

236
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,715
specific relationship in Native American culture between

237
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,980
humans, and the natural environment.

238
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,655
As Therry and Deviney put it:

239
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,655
 

240
00:11:21,655 --> 00:11:24,425
 

241
00:11:24,425 --> 00:11:26,880
 

242
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,275
So, even though Raven and Coyote pull tricks, that might seem

243
00:11:30,275 --> 00:11:33,355
outrageous and a little gross, its hard to consider them

244
00:11:33,355 --> 00:11:36,155
evil or detrimental to society

245
00:11:36,155 --> 00:11:39,045
especially when their tricks end up creating something

246
00:11:39,045 --> 00:11:42,035
the rest of us get to enjoy.

247
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,940
Thanks for watching, we'll see you next week.

258
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:19,485
 

259
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:23,235

00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:24,275
