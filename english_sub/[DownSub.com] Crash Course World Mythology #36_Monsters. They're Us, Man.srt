00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,180
Hi there, I’m Mike Rugnetta, this is Crashcourse
Mythology and today is the first of a few

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:09,410
episodes focused on one of the greatest aspects
of myths-in-general: Mythical cvreatures.

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,170
More specifically: monsters.

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:14,980
And today: one, terrible, international monster
in particular.

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,040
But don’t worry Thoth, I’ll protect you.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,930
Uuhh… as long as you also promise to protect
me.

7
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:20,930
HEY!

8
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,250
WHERE YOU GOING?

9
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:27,170
NO WE DEFINITELY SHOULD NOT ‘SPLIT UP TO
COVER MORE GROUND’

10
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:36,879
INTRO
What do we mean by the word “monster”?

11
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:38,749
Well, quite a lot!

12
00:00:38,749 --> 00:00:43,039
In English we use “monster” to describe
something or someone outside the bounds of

13
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:45,670
acceptable form or behavior.

14
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:49,309
Monster comes from the Latin word that means
“to show,” and we see its root in words

15
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:50,780
like demonstrate.

16
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:56,579
But, monsters don’t just act monstrously,
their monstrosity is usually pretty visible

17
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:57,909
without much action.

18
00:00:57,909 --> 00:01:04,110
Almost any mythical creature could technically
qualify as a monster, but from our studies

19
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,780
you probably get a sense it’s trickier than
that.

20
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:12,010
Unicorns, for instance, are way outside normal
appearance and behavior... but no one calls

21
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,010
them monsters.

22
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,590
The sphinx provides another way to think through
this.

23
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:20,830
There are actually a number of sphinxes – but
most applicable here are the Egyptian Androsphinxes,

24
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:26,420
with a male head... like the Great Sphinx
at Giza, and the Greek Sphinx, with a female

25
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,420
head.

26
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,060
The Egyptian Sphinx was mighty, and powerful
- but mostly considered benevolent, guarding

27
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,670
entrances to temples and pyramids.

28
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:41,430
While the Greek Sphinx was considered FEROCIOUS
… and would mercilessly eat those who were

29
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,890
not able to answer her riddle.

30
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:49,560
So we might ask - in that duo - which is the
creature? and which… is the monst er?

31
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,940
Beyond some naturalistic boundary, to get
labeled a “monster,” a mythical creature

32
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,600
usually has to transgress some kind of social
boundary, as well.

33
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,870
If you consider it from a psychological perspective,
particular brands of monstrosity often embody

34
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,070
particular human fears.

35
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:10,709
Shapeshifters aren’t automatically “monstrous”
simply because they change forms–think of

36
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:15,849
Professor McGonagall, or even The Doctor–but
because often that ability can be used to

37
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:21,580
DECEIVE–think Mystique–or lead to UNCONTROLLABLE
URGES, like with werewolves.

38
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:27,410
Vampires are another example: they may be
a human-bat combo… but that’s not REALLY

39
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,800
why they’re monstrous.

40
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,420
Vampires are bad because of their thirst for
human blood - which is a pretty serious transgression

41
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,530
of social norms.

42
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:41,409
Often some naturalistic transgression is simply
an outward sign of what makes monsters TRULY

43
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:46,410
evil: what anthropology professor David Gilmore
calls, an “unmotivated wickedness towards

44
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,410
humans.”

45
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,310
This can take ... different forms.

46
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,430
The most common version is: monsters eat people.

47
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,269
But sometimes that wickedness is more complicated,
and has more to do with the person who is

48
00:02:56,269 --> 00:02:58,819
afraid than the thing doing the scaring.

49
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:01,090
But why do monsters even exist?

50
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,430
Well, lots of reasons!

51
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,540
Monsters are often sent by gods to punish
humans for some transgression.

52
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,859
One of the most common images of a monster
in western art for example, is the sea monster

53
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:15,019
sent by Poseidon to devour Andromeda.

54
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:16,019
Why?

55
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:20,579
Because her mother Cassiopeia had bragged
that she was more beautiful than the Nereids.

56
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:24,219
Humans, just... don’t brag when gods are
around.

57
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:25,969
It never goes well.

58
00:03:25,969 --> 00:03:28,480
Luckily, Andromeda was saved by Perseus.

59
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,640
And hey, that’s another reason to have some
monsters around: you gotta give heroes something

60
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,640
to fight!

61
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,450
Our friend Joseph Campbell, among otshers,
has identified the basic pattern of hero vs

62
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,450
monster stories.

63
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:43,310
It’s a three-part, repetitive cycle where
the monster mysteriously appears from a dark

64
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:47,390
shadow world to menace some previously-peaceful
locale.

65
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:52,999
After the monster brings death and destruction,
the besieged community calls upon a hero who

66
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:53,999
saves them.

67
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:59,300
The community rejoices, only to have the monster,
or one of the monster’s kin, return and

68
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,300
re-start the cycle.

69
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,109
A classic example of this is Beowulf.

70
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:06,779
Grendel shows up, Beowulf defeats him, and
just when he thinks he’s all done, Grendel’s

71
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:10,050
MOM shows up, and Beowulf has to get all heroic
all over again.

72
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:15,059
Today, however, we have a monster even more
terrifying than Grendel’s super mad momma.

73
00:04:15,059 --> 00:04:18,060
This incredibly frightening monster comes
from…

74
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,060
Canada.

75
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,858
Sorry, Thoughtbubble: this one’s for you,
eh.

76
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:27,240
Once upon a time in the late 19th century,
a first nations group is living in a camp

77
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,500
on the Berens River.

78
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,030
One day, a hunter is driven by hunger and
leaves camp to go trapping.

79
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:39,199
A few days later, people in the camp hear
the trapper screaming and howling in the woods.

80
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,539
Everyone knows what’s happening.

81
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:46,440
The trapper has become a Wendigo, a terrifying,
man-eating ogre.

82
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,440
But wait.

83
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,440
It gets worse.

84
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,440
A brave group goes to look for the trapper
and find his family, all dead.

85
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,169
And hey, worse still, half eaten.

86
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:59,530
They return and tell their story, and panic
runs through the camp.

87
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:05,060
The people know that soon the Wendigo will
come for them, and they don’t feel like

88
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,060
being eaten.

89
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,240
So they call a council.

90
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:13,670
At the council an intrepid young warrior named
Rotten Log stands up and volunteers to fight

91
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,670
the Wendigo.

92
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,630
That night they go to the forest and build
a fire.

93
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:24,490
Sure enough, a huge monster arrives, This…
is almost certainly the Wendigo.

94
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:30,440
The Wendigo attacks Rotten Log, trying to
slash his throat and eat him, but Rotten Log

95
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,080
has a guardian spirit he calls on to save
him.

96
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:41,139
The spirit gives Rotten Log supernatural strength,
and after a long battle, he finally defeats

97
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:42,139
the Wendigo.

98
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:45,780
The hunters bring the creature back to the
camp and the people rejoice.

99
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,780
But the Wendigo isn’t dead.

100
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,789
Not yet.

101
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:51,580
The only way to kill a Wendigo is to melt
its icy heart.

102
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,860
So the peoplethrow him on a raging fire.

103
00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:00,970
The flames heat the beast, his heart defrosts,
and the Wendigo finally dies.

104
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,120
Thank you Thoughtbubble.

105
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,780
Yeah, as far as ogres go, I think I prefer
Shrek.

106
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:11,080
As I mentioned that this story was from Canada,
but there are countless others.

107
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,889
According to Gilmore, the Wendigo has the
distinction of being the monster whose mythology

108
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:19,080
has the greatest geographical reach in the
world.

109
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,129
Wendigo stories, and the hysteria that accompanies
them, have been reported all across Canada

110
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:25,710
and as far south as...North Dakota.

111
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:31,330
They are common among most of the Algonquian-speaking
native tribes, but especially the Ojibwa and

112
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,600
Salteaux Manitoba.

113
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,870
The Wendigo is, in many ways, the quintessential
monster.

114
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:41,550
It’s big, it has superhuman strength, and
it’s really mean to people.

115
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:45,879
Wendigos are humanoid in appearance, with
two legs, but almost everything else about

116
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:49,150
them is misshapen and grotesque.

117
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:54,770
Their hands are paws with twelve inch long
claws, and their feet, each a yard long, have

118
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,270
a single toe with one long, sharp nail.

119
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:04,510
Wendigos have huge yellow eyes, like an owl,
and a giant mouth and no lips, because their

120
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:08,030
cannibalistic hunger causes them to devour
THEIR own flesh.

121
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:13,370
Their breath is so powerful and loud that
it seems like a windstorm, and their howling

122
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:16,400
sends those who hear it into a panic.

123
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,300
Think you can hide from a Wendigo?

124
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,610
Maybe in the river?

125
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,610
Nope.

126
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:23,629
They can walk on water or swim beneath it
like a seal.

127
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:27,979
They can subsist on mushrooms, rotting wood,
moss... basically anything you find on the

128
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:29,099
forest floor.

129
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:35,569
But their favorite food is people, and THAT…
really, is what makes them MONSTERS.

130
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:41,030
There are both male and female Wendigos and
when a male and female meet, they fight until

131
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,759
one of them dies.

132
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:47,509
But … if male and female Wendigos would
rather fight than breed, then where do new

133
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,999
Wendigos come from?

134
00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:50,590
A monster stork maybe?

135
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:56,560
As the story makes clear, they come from us,
the ranks of the desperate and hungry.

136
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,539
Ordinary humans, often driven by hunger, can
become possessed by the spirit of the Wendigo

137
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:04,229
and turn to cannibalism.

138
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:09,800
These metamorphoses are often brought on by
the starvation that can occur in cold winter

139
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,800
months.

140
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,940
In many of the stories, this Wendigo possession
is accompanied by incredible physical changes.

141
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:21,800
A person who has “gone Wendigo” will grow
in size and their appearance will become coarse

142
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
and wild.

143
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,610
As the Wendigo’s heart freezes, the urge
to eat human flesh grows, eventually becoming

144
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,610
irresistible.

145
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:35,929
This idea that anyone can transform into a
Wendigo is found in the most typical Wendigo

146
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:37,578
origin story.

147
00:08:37,578 --> 00:08:43,138
That very first, ancient Wendigo was a Native
North American who was transformed into a

148
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:45,410
monster by overpowering hunger.

149
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:50,940
This story is so real to many who hear it
that it has caused actual Wendigo panics in

150
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,430
Canada up through the twentieth century.

151
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:58,360
How do we understand the endurance of the
Wendigo legend?

152
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,990
Well, I think just about all of us can agree
that cannibalism is a pretty terrifying and

153
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,410
taboo thing.

154
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:11,399
The Wendigo represents a fear of cannibalism
and a fear that we might lose control of ourselves

155
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:15,490
and violate, perhaps violently, some set of
social norms, like… not eating your neighbor.

156
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:21,510
People usually don’t grow three-foot monster
toes, but they do sometimes lose their grip.

157
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:26,380
Which is to say, the “monster legend”
is alive and well... although maybe more as

158
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,790
a metaphor than as a real yellow-eyed creature.

159
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,880
All humans have the capacity to become monstrous.

160
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,610
Even me... and maybe even...

161
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:37,610
Thoth.

162
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,610
Thanks for watching.

163
00:09:38,610 --> 00:00:00,000
We’ll see you next week… unless this guy
sees you first.
