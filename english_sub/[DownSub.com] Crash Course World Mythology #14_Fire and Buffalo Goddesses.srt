00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,290
Aloha I'm Mike Rugnetta, and this is
Crash Course Mythology and today we're

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,500
going to continue looking at goddesses,
and what makes them so great!

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,500
In this episode we'll focus on two myths:

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,200
one about a volcano goddess,

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,000
and another about White Buffalo Calf Woman.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,630
We're going to look at these myths a bit more in-depth

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,200
than we usually do, and head to places we
haven't talked about much before:

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,000
Hawaii and North America.  Y'all packed, Ttoth?

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,600
Ooh!

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,000
Ooh!
..Nice! Sharp!

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,500
*title music, images and jokes*

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
*jokes you'll need to pause the video to read, honestly*

13
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,570
Longtime crash-course fans may remember
that Hawaiian mythology featured heavily

14
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,700
in our episode about Captain Cook.

15
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,000
The
god in question then was "Lono,"

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,110
who was supposed to be pretty powerful, but he
was only one of the great gods who

17
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:53,020
followed Pele, the fire goddess, to Hawaii
from the land beyond the vast oceans.

18
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,300
By the time Cook arrived in Hawaii, Pele
was the most feared and respected of

19
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,340
Hawaii's divinities, holding court with her
five brothers and sisters in the Kilauea

20
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,000
Volcano--which is a scary place to hold
court, but very convenient if you like BBQ.

21
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,390
Pele exemplifies the "Triple-Goddess"
that we talked about in the previous episode:

22
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,200
she's a goddess of life AND
death--

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,000
controlling the lava that gives the Hawaiian islands its rich, fertile soil

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,500
but-also destroys EVERYTHING in its path.

25
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,800
And in this story we also see her as

26
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,000
the regenerative goddess of sexual allure and creativity.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,200
In short, "This girl / is on fi-yah!" ...(emoji)

28
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,500
One day Pele decided to come out of her smoldering pit at Kilauea to go to the beach.

29
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,200
After frolicking in the Hawaiian surf with her sisters,

30
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,500
she lay down for a nap in a cave.

31
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,200
But before she fell asleep,

32
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,800
she warned her sisters 
that if any of them woke her

33
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,000
she would kill them all!

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,200
(Whoa, grouchy!)

35
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,560
If it were absolutely necessary to awaken her

36
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,600
she said that her youngest sister,

37
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,100
Hi'iaka, should be the one to do it.

38
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,900
At the time, Hi'iaka was out playing in the Lehua groves,

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,200
and making friends with a tree spirit, named Hopoe,

40
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,600
who quickly became Hi'iaka's best friend.

41
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,580
Meanwhile, the dream
spirit of the sleeping Pele traveled to

42
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,840
Kauai where there was a hula performance in the Alaka sacred hall.

43
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,200
And there she found the prince Lohiau.

44
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,900
The prince saw her and fell in love with her instantly.

45
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,980
He invited her to eat with him
and then go back to his house.

46
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,180
Pele allowed the prince to kiss her but not
to touch her--which is a little confusing,

47
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:30,220
because, isn't kissing a kind of touching?--
anyway, the Prince tried getting handsy

48
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,800
anyway, and Pele floated away back to
Hawaii.

49
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,400
Distraught beyond compare,

50
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,600
he (Lohiau) hanged himself with his loincloth.

51
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,800
Thaught Bubble, you can take it from here.

52
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:45,000
After a few days Pele's sisters grew
worried about her trance-like nap

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
and summoned Hi'iaka to wake her.

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,310
The little sister chanted over her big sister's body

55
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:53,200
and the great goddess woke up (and didn't kill anyone).

56
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,100
Pele asked each of her sisters to go to Kauai

57
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,600
and fetch Lohiau, but they were all too afraid

58
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,100
to make the journey--except for Hi'iaka.

59
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,600
Pele promised the youngest sister that-

60
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:09,100
-after she accomplished her task, Pele
would take Lohiau as a lover

61
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,300
for five days and nights, 
and then he would belong to Hi'iaka.

62
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,000
Before going, Hi'iaka made Pele promise

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,100
not to destroy the Lehua groves
where her friend Hopoe lived.

64
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,100
She also asked for some of Pele's
magic power to help her on her journey.

65
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,140
Hi'iaka made the dangerous trip to Kauai

66
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:31,800
where she found that Lohiau had been dead..
for many days.

67
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,200
--well, mostly dead.

68
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,080
Hi'iaka looked closely and noticed above the
prince's body a dim ghost-Spirit hovering.

69
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:45,350
Using all her extra magic power
she brought Lohiau back to life.

70
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:49,000
While Hi'iaka was away on her journey, 
Pele broke her promise,

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,200
and her lava destroyed the Lehua groves!
--KILLING Hopoe!

72
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,800
Hi'iaka saw this betrayal so she decided that, 
since the bargain was broken,

73
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,100
she would take Lohiau as her own, saying,

74
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,738
"I have faithfully kept
the compact between myself and my sister,"

75
00:04:04,738 --> 00:04:06,200
"I have not touched her lover,"

76
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,200
"I have not let him caress me,"

77
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,100
"I have not given him a kiss."

78
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,500
"Now that compact is at an end."

79
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,900
"I am free to treat this handsome man
 as my own lover,"

80
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,100
"-this man, who has had a desire for me."

81
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:23,500
"And I will let Pele with her own eyes see the compact broken."

82
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,100
Thank you Thought Bubble!

83
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,600
So that's exactly what Hi'iaka did.

84
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,000
When their sisters saw her kissing Lohiau,

85
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,900
they tattled to Pele, who responded,

86
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,900
"Mouths were made made for kissing."

87
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,900
Which makes it seem like she's okay with it

88
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,100
--but she's definitely not okay with it.

89
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,600
Pele called upon the other great gods

90
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,000
to help her destroy Lohiau..

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,100
which they did..

92
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,130
with LAVA.

93
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:50,100
The lava spared Hi'iaka but flowed over Lohiau

94
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,600
who died...

95
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,900
AGAIN.

96
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,800
Pele, still angry, would have destroyed the world itself,

97
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,500
but another God, Kane the earth-shaper, 
calmed her down.

98
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,800
The story doesn't end
there though.

99
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,600
A great sorcerer came to the pit where Pele and her sisters lived

100
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,200
and asked them why his friend, Lohiau, had been destroyed.

101
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,330
After the sisters told him, he asked, 
"why, since Lohiau had

102
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,200
already died, did he have to die again?"

103
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,400
Pele asked him to explain what he meant

104
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,100
and the sorcerer told her

105
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:26,200
about what Hi'iaka had done on Kauai to save Lohiau.

106
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,800
Hi'iaka confirmed her deeds,

107
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,000
explaining that she had saved him,

108
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,100
but only smooched him

109
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,200
after learning Pele off'd her rad tree pal.

110
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,900
The sorcerer then asked Pele to show herself to him.

111
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,500
He fell down and adored her,

112
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,100
an act which seemed to soften her heart.

113
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:46,400
Pele sent to her brother, Ka-moho-alii, to find Lohiau's spirit

114
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,500
and bring him back to life.

115
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,900
Hi'iaka found him in the charred groves,

116
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,200
the place where the destroyed Lehua

117
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,100
were beginning to grow again.

118
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,100
As they wandered together through Hawaii,

119
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,200
they knew that the goddess of the pit

120
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,200
was not now so terror-inspiring.

121
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,500
As a mother goddess,

122
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,480
Pele has power over life and,

123
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,200
Pele has power over life and,
especially,

124
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,200
Pele has power over life and,
especially, death.

125
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,800
Her actions are often destructive
but also..

126
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,880
Her actions are often destructive
but also.. regenerative.

127
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,900
By the end of the story,

128
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,100
the Lehua groves are regrowing, and

129
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,000
the love between her sister and the prince is rekindled.

130
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,900
the love between her sister and the prince is rekindled. 
(wink!)

131
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,960
While Pele's powers are terrible,

132
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,200
we should also note that she sometimes
chooses to limit them.

133
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,380
Pele makes threats,

134
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,000
including the threat of killing her
sisters,

135
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,070
but she doesn't follow through.

136
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,500
Circumstances can also alter her
behavior.

137
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,100
When she discovers the truth about Hi'iaka's loyalty,

138
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,100
and her efforts to bring Lohiau back,

139
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,200
Pele's attitude changes. She.. .

140
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,200
Pele's attitude changes. She.. . 
cools off a bit.

141
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,900
Does this mean that our actions towards the gods

142
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,800
can influence their actions upon us?

143
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,000
Or is it primarily an analogy for how we, as humans,

144
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,900
should behave towards one another:

145
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,100
honoring our elders, but also keeping our promises.

146
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,000
Maybe it's just about n ot getting
hot under the collar about your sister!

147
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The creation of the social order is another aspect of

148
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,800
great goddess mythology.

149
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,000
One we can see echoed in our next story:

150
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,800
The White Buffalo Calf Woman.

151
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,200
The Lakota, Nakota and Dakota tribes who populate the northern

152
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,360
Great Plains of the United States, and
part of Canada, are sometimes lumped under

153
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,879
the name, "Sioux," but since that has
pejorative connotations

154
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,000
we're going with the "D'Danke Oh Yah De," or 
"Buffalo Nation."

155
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,200
The people of the Buffalo Nation have a complex religious system

156
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,500
that sees the world as challenging and haphazard,

157
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,200
forcing people to accept loss

158
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,100
and work to complete the unfinished world.

159
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:35,000
In this context the White Buffalo Calf Woman
is a culture bringer;

160
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,169
"She gives the [Buffalo Nation People] objects
and practices that symbolize and define

161
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:44,400
their way of relating to the spirit and
human worlds."

162
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,200
This is a version of her story:

163
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:46,800
Long ago

164
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,100
the people of the [Buffalo Nation] came together

165
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,800
at the seven sacred council fires because

166
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,200
there was no game and the people were starving.

167
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,200
They decided to send two Scouts to find 
something--anything--to eat.

168
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,100
This was so long ago that it was before horses,

169
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,900
so the scouts would have to go out on foot.

170
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:10,000
The two Scouts searched everywhere,
but found nothing;

171
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,900
until one day, they spotted a distant figure

172
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,000
floating...

173
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,200
floating...
not walking!

174
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,319
--and because of this they knew that

175
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,100
that person was "wakan," or "holy."

176
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,500
This person was Ptesan-Wi, 
the White Buffalo Calf Woman,

177
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,379
and she was very beautiful.

178
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:28,200
Each man saw her and reacted differently.

179
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,200
One was in awe of her,

180
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,500
but the other was overcome.. by desire..

181
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,000
and he tried to touch her.

182
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Instantly he was struck by lightning,

183
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,500
and burned into a heap of black bones.

184
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,500
So, if we've learned anything today, its that-

185
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,000
Goddess Groping = Gruesome Death.

186
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
White Buffalo Calf Woman told the other Scout

187
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,639
that good things would come to the
Buffalo Nation people, and that he should

188
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:53,200
return to camp and await her arrival.

189
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,139
He did as he was told, and the camp

190
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:57,100
prepared itself for the holy one.

191
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,949
Four days later White Buffalo Calf Woman

192
00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:02,009
arrived with a bundle and was made
welcome.

193
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:04,000
She told the people to create an altar

194
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
and a rack for the holy thing that she had brought them.

195
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,790
When they had done as she instructed,

196
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,000
she opened the bundle and revealed..

197
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,200
..the "Chanunpa," the sacred pipe.

198
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,610
the White Buffalo Calf Woman showed the people how
to pray, and how to use the pipe:

199
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:21,600
How to fill it, and sing the songs
that went along with it. She told them,

200
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,100
"With this holy pipe you will walk like a living prayer.

201
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,800
With your feet resting upon the Earth

202
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,000
and the pipe-stem reaching into the sky

203
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,100
your body forms a living bridge

204
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,000
between the sacred beneath and the sacred above.

205
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,800
Wakan Tanka smiles upon us, because now we are one:

206
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,400
earth,

207
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,100
sky,

208
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,590
all living things,

209
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,200
the two-legged,

210
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
the four-legged,

211
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,600
the winged ones,

212
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,800
the trees

213
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,700
the grasses.

214
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:52,000
Together with the people, they are all related,

215
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,200
one family,

216
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,600
the pipe holds them together."

217
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,200
She told them of the pipe's symbolism:

218
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,030
the bowl and the stem were carved by men,

219
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,900
and the decoration of the pipe was the 
work of women.

220
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:08,500
The pipe binds men and women together and is used in marriage ceremonies.

221
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,500
Women, according to the White Buffalo Calf Woman, 
are equal to men in importance

222
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,800
because their work and their bodies

223
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,400
keep the people alive.

224
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,700
"You are
from the mother earth,"

225
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,350
she told the women.

226
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,900
"What you are doing is as great as what
the warriors do."

227
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,500
The White Buffalo Calf Woman gave many gifts to the Buffalo Nation

228
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,500
including corn, wild turnips,

229
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,500
and the knowledge of how to cook wild turnips,

230
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,200
which--I mean, I sure as heck wouldn't know so,

231
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,800
thanks Ptesan-Wi!

232
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,200
She told the people that they were special,

233
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,500
and that this was why they had been
given the Chanunpa.

234
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,800
Most important, when the White Buffalo Calf woman
left the people,

235
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,800
promising that she would see them again,

236
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,500
the great buffalo herds appeared,

237
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,200
allowing themselves to be killed-

238
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,500
-so that people could eat and live.

239
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,900
Unlike the Pele story,

240
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,600
Ptesan-Wi's interactions are mostly with humans

241
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,600
and with groups

242
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,000
rather than other gods or individuals.

243
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,200
And rather than being mercurial,
 the White Buffalo Calf Woman

244
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,800
offers a sense of order,

245
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,000
and a sense that the right behavior will be rewarded.

246
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,100
In short, great goddesses are powerful,

247
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,700
great goddesses are desirable,

248
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,100
the goddesses giveth,

249
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,800
and the great goddesses taketh away.

250
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,570
And, in a way, they suggest a relationship
between the sacred and the profane;

251
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:23,800
teetering, like many deities, on a line between

252
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,900
worldly desire and otherworldly authority.

253
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,200
So, maybe most importantly,
remember:

254
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,830
terrible things will happen to you

255
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,000
if you try to touch a great goddess
without permission.

256
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,000
Consent is Sexy!

257
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,200

"Mouths were made for kissing!"

272
00:12:19,800 --> 00:00:00,000
"Mouths were made for kissing!"
*smooch*
