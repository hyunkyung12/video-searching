00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,970
Hi I’m Mike Rugnetta, this is Crashcourse
Mythology, and today we’re wrapping up creation

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:05,970
myths.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,400
Over the past four episodes we’ve seen the
universe created from nothing, via the actions

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,860
of earth mothers, sky fathers, and of course,
vomiting supreme beings.

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,689
We’ve seen creation used to explore the
relationships between parents and children

6
00:00:17,689 --> 00:00:19,460
and between men and women.

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,460
And snakes.

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,150
And on that note, today, we’re going to
examine the earthly interconnection between

9
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,470
humans and animals.

10
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,140
High five, Thoth!

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,140
What?

12
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,499
Yes, I know humans are animals.

13
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:39,810
You know what I mean.

14
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:44,310
INTRO
Before we get into the creation myths, let’s

15
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,250
start with a little scientific mythology about
man’s best friend.

16
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,140
Of course, I mean dogs.

17
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,680
Sorry Thoth.

18
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,470
Dogs were, if not the first, then among the
first domesticated animals, and they play

19
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,420
an important role in mythology.

20
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,420
Romulus?

21
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,420
Remus?

22
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,710
I’m looking in your direction.

23
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,519
One of the stories that we tell about the
domestication of dogs is that it started when

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,009
early hunter gatherers chose to tame and then
breed some of the less aggressive wolves in

25
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:14,500
order to increase the hunters’ capacity
to capture game.

26
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,929
Eventually, these cross and interbred wolves
became dogs.

27
00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:19,249
Who’s a good boy?

28
00:01:19,249 --> 00:01:20,280
Who’s a good boy?

29
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,280
Thats Right!

30
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,520
Any canine that didn’t bite off your hand
is a good boy!

31
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,119
It’s a nice story and it seems to make sense,
but there are problems with it.

32
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,859
In an article in National Geographic, Brian
Hare and Vanessa Woods argue that some scientists

33
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:36,600
are flipping this narrative on its head and
saying that it was wolves that sought out

34
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,899
humans, rather than the other way around.

35
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:43,100
It doesn’t make much sense for humans to
try to capture wolves and get them to work

36
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,190
for us.

37
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:47,280
Early hunter gatherers were pretty good at
hunting, which is why they might have been

38
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,560
to blame for the destruction of megafauna
in the prehistoric world.

39
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,170
Also, why would humans want to share the spoils
of the hunt with a wolf?

40
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,439
They’re hungry.

41
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,439
Like the wolf.

42
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,450
Hare and Woods explain that scientists think
it is more likely that wolves approached humans,

43
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,679
probably by scavenging around their garbage
pits.

44
00:02:05,679 --> 00:02:10,250
These would have been the friendliest wolves;
aggressive ones would have been killed by

45
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,450
anxious humans.

46
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:15,920
So, it was the friendly wolves that, over
many generations, were bred into the loveable

47
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,830
vacuum hating rapscallions that we know and
love.

48
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:20,980
Don’t ask me about cats, though.

49
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,680
I got nothing there.

50
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,349
Are cats even really domesticated?

51
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:26,050
I feel like they’re hiding something.

52
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,050
There’s some plot.

53
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,160
They’re up to something.

54
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,610
Let’s return, as we so often do, to the
Judeo-Christian Biblical story of creation

55
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,849
from Genesis.

56
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:37,970
In Chapter One, after creating the heavens
and the earth and the stars and all the animals:

57
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:43,260
God said, “Let us make man in our image,
after our likeness; and let them have dominion

58
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,910
over the fish of the sea, and over the birds
of the air, and over the cattle, and over

59
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,730
all the earth and over every creeping thing
that creeps upon the earth.”

60
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:58,959
So God created man in his own image, in the
image of God he created him; male and female

61
00:02:58,959 --> 00:02:59,959
he created them.”

62
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:04,849
(Gen 1 26-27) … And God said, “Behold
I have given you every plant yielding seed

63
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:10,099
which is upon the face of all the earth and
every tree with every seed in its fruit; you

64
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:12,269
shall have them for food.

65
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:16,829
And to every beast of the earth, and to every
bird of the air, and to everything that creeps

66
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:23,670
on the earth, everything that has breath of
life, I have given every green plant for food.”

67
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,670
And it was so.

68
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,670
(Gen 1 29-30).

69
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,670
Sounds like more gardening to me, surprise
surprise.

70
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,709
In the second chapter of Genesis, God grants
humans control over the other earthly creatures

71
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:32,630
in a slightly different way.

72
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,849
In this version, God creates man before the
animals.

73
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:40,439
Then the LORD God said, “It is not good
that man should be alone; I will make him

74
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:42,290
a helper fit for him.”

75
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:47,790
So out of the ground the Lord God formed every
beast of the field and every bird of the air,

76
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:51,950
and brought them to the man to see what he
would call them; and whatever the man called

77
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,719
every living creature, that was its name.”

78
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:55,760
(Gen 2 18-19)
Isn’t that nice?

79
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,450
Giraffes and sharks and biting flies were
made just to help us.

80
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:03,709
Both creation stories set up a clear hierarchy
in the animal world with human beings at the

81
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:08,500
top given the power to do whatever they want
with all animals below them.

82
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,590
Basically, they’re our interns.

83
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,629
The second version of the story affirms human
control over animals in two ways.

84
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:17,978
First, by having man created prior to the
animal kingdom, humans are granted literal

85
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:19,038
primacy.

86
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:24,500
Then, their power is increased over animals
by the first man receiving the privilege of

87
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,500
naming them.

88
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,150
And, I mean, he did a pretty good job.

89
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,060
Especially with hippopotamus.

90
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:35,020
But not all myths about humans and animals
employ this strict hierarchy.

91
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,820
In a number of creation stories from Native
American tribes animals are partners in creation,

92
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:45,340
often acting as guides or even as the key
participants in creating the earth.

93
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,069
The tribes of what is now the Southwestern
United States have creation stories that follow

94
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:52,639
a model we haven’t yet seen, the emergence
myth.

95
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:58,650
In these stories, humans or creatures that
become humans are led from an original underground

96
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:04,259
world into a series of interim worlds until
they emerge into the surface world that is

97
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:05,979
recognizably earth.

98
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:11,300
In a Hopi version of this story, various animals
including the Spider Grandmother, and a chipmunk

99
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:16,440
help to find the entry hole or sipapuni, to
the land beyond the sky.

100
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,240
Apparently, there is one of these entry ways
in the Grand Canyon.

101
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:24,240
In a Navajo version of the emergence story,
the people, who are also sort of insects,

102
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,250
fly through the sipapuni into the higher world,
assisted by swallows.

103
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,990
I like these myths.

104
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,360
Humans working with nature!

105
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,690
Literally rising towards creation!

106
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:40,289
It’s just a nice breath of fresh air, almost
literally, after all the vomiting and death

107
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:41,360
that we’ve had so far.

108
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,540
Another type of creation story featuring animal
helpers is called the earth diver myth.

109
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,270
A good example comes from the Iroquois Indians
of the Northeastern Woodlands of the United

110
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,270
States.

111
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,270
Let’s dive into Thoughtbubble.

112
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:55,390
A long time ago, humans lived up in the sky
in what we now consider heaven.

113
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:59,889
The daughter of their great chief became very
sick, and they were unable to cure her.

114
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:05,680
In the village was a great tree on which grew
the corn that had fed all the people.

115
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,690
One of the chief’s friends had a dream in
which he was told to tell the chief to lay

116
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:13,280
his daughter beside the tree and dig it up.

117
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,710
The chief did as the dream said.

118
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:19,180
While this was going on an angry young man
came along.

119
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,629
The angry young man didn’t have the best
bedside manner.

120
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:27,050
He pointed out the tree provided the fruit
which fed the people, and gave the sick daughter

121
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,949
a push with his foot.

122
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:32,430
She fell through the hole that had been left
when the tree had been dug up.

123
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:37,440
The young woman fell into this world, which
at the time was all water.

124
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,319
On this water floated ducks, and geese and
all the other water birds.

125
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:45,650
As there was no earth on this water at the
time, there was no place for the falling woman

126
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:50,860
to land, so the birds joined their bodies
together into a sort of duck island, where

127
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,169
the falling woman landed.

128
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:56,980
After some time, the birds grew tired and
asked who would care for the woman.

129
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:02,040
The Great Turtle took the woman, and when
he grew tired he asked who would take care

130
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,040
of her.

131
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,389
They decided to prepare land on which she
would live-- the earth.

132
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:11,789
The Toad, after some convincing, dove to the
bottom of the primal sea, and collected soil

133
00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:15,129
which was placed on the broad carapace of
the Great Turtle.

134
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:21,380
It increased in size until it provided the
land to accommodate all the living creatures.

135
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,380
Thanks Thoughtbubble.

136
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,340
And nice work, water birds.

137
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,470
Also, Toad.

138
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,669
Thoth, meet Toad.

139
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:33,340
So there’s a lot more to the myth than this,
but it captures the key elements of the earth

140
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,530
diver story.

141
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:38,110
Although it has some things in common with
other creation myths we’ve seen, especially

142
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:43,690
the idea that the world began as water, the
relationship between human beings and animals

143
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:44,740
it’s quite different.

144
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,161
For one thing, far from being dumb creatures
waiting to be named and tamed by a man, these

145
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:53,300
animals can talk, think, deliberate and plan.

146
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,300
Animal empowerment!

147
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,780
They also have emotions similar to the ones
we feel, especially getting tired and bored

148
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,310
of a tedious task.

149
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:04,340
Think about this the next time you watch a
horse pull a cart, or you’re trying to entertain

150
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,669
your cat by waving that feathery thing in
front him.

151
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:08,319
I’m telling you: they’re gettin’ fed
up.

152
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,039
Even more important than being given real
agency in this creation story, it’s the

153
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,949
animals who both save humans’ progenitors,
and create our home.

154
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:22,699
Without the helpful turtle and the brave toad,
there would be no land to live on, and also

155
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:24,560
no earth to grow food.

156
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,689
The creation of the world requires animals
and thus it is crucially important to be grateful

157
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:31,689
to them.

158
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:34,919
These Native American myths are very intricate
and when you read them – and you should

159
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:38,809
– it’s important to remember that they
are very different from many of the other

160
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:44,660
creation stories because they are living stories,
communicated by way of a constantly evolving

161
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,839
oral tradition, unlike more or less stable
literary texts.

162
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,920
Still, one of the interpretive take-aways
from these emergence and earth diver stories

163
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:59,120
is that Native Americans perceive a different
relationship between animals and nature and

164
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,670
humans than people from other traditions.

165
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:06,079
According to the biblical tradition, human
beings have a special relationship with God

166
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:09,750
who prefers them to all other creatures.

167
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,899
According to mythology professors Eva Thury
and Margaret Devinney, “This privilege has

168
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:19,850
been interpreted by some as giving believers
the right to dispose of nature as they please.”

169
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:24,230
On the other hand, according to these scholars,
“Native Americans view this world … as

170
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:29,970
the place where their destinies will be fulfilled,
not by domination but by maintaining a balance

171
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:36,110
achieved by living in harmony with themselves
and other humans as well as with animals and

172
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,589
the exterior world.”

173
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:41,579
Now some of you might be saying, wait, this
sounds like a stereotypical view of Native

174
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:45,520
Americans, like they have some mystical connection
with nature and that we should look to them

175
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,390
for a way to understand how better to live
in harmony with it.

176
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:52,520
And you would be right, that is a cultural
stereotype, one that has often been uncritically

177
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,209
linked with an idea of Native Americans as
primitive.

178
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:59,850
But, I will say, maybe in comparison to the
other stories we’ve heard, with all the

179
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:05,570
vomiting, and wars, and eating of children,
it’s kind of nice think of the universe

180
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:10,110
as a place of collaboration, and not one of
acrimony.

181
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:41,649
Except that jerk who kicked 
that lady down the hole.

182
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:47,019
Thanks for watching.

183
00:10:47,019 --> 00:00:00,000
See you next episode.
