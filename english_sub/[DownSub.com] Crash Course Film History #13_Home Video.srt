Hello, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Film History.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,460
Gone are the days when the only way to experience
film was buying a ticket at your local theater.

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:13,120
Instead, you can watch almost anything you
want, whenever you want, wherever you want.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,500
Film studios have made much of their back
catalogs available to the public, with things

5
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,910
like DVDs and Blu-ray Discs, or online streaming
services.

6
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:23,440
And you can screen movies on TVs, computers,
tablets, phones, and even some watches…

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,440
if you squint really hard.

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,640
Home video transformed the film industry,
and the ways we find and consume motion pictures.

[Opening Music Plays]

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,280
True home movies – films you can watch at

11
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,220
home – didn’t exist until the invention
of 8mm film in the mid-1930s.

12
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:51,980
The first standard 8mm film stock was actually
made from 16mm film with extra sprocket holes

13
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:53,210
down the side.

14
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,589
Filmmakers would run a 16mm film strip through
a camera once to expose one half of the frame,

15
00:00:57,589 --> 00:01:00,200
and then run it in the other direction to
expose the other half.

16
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,599
Then, during processing, they split the strip
down the center, creating two 8mm film strips

17
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,860
that could be spliced together.

18
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,460
...it's just a lot of work.

19
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,990
Compared to traditional 35mm film, 8mm film
was more portable and much less expensive

20
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,170
to buy and develop.

21
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,610
But it had one major drawback: When 8mm film
was projected on a big screen, the image quality

22
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,810
couldn’t hold a candle to 35mm.

23
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,500
Most home movie makers weren’t projecting
their films onto giant screens, though.

24
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,079
Instead, they would just hang up a sheet or
use a plain wall.

25
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:26,799
And for that, 8mm film did the trick.

26
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,920
In the 1950s and ‘60s, as the American middle
class expanded after World War II, 8mm film

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,220
cameras became more common.

28
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,659
Chances are, there’s some grainy, unsteady
footage of your family’s old vacations,

29
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:40,040
birthdays, weddings, or other special occasions
tucked away in an attic somewhere.

30
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,900
Who's attic? My attic?

31
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,340
Now, what really brought home movies into
the mainstream was the advent of home video

32
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,340
technology.

33
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,430
And Betamax – or Beta for short – was
one of the world’s first.

34
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:53,939
Invented in Japan and introduced to the United
States in 1975, Beta could record audio and

35
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:57,060
video signals to a magnetic tape, much like
the ones in audio cassettes.

36
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,159
You see, video technologies record break up
recorded images into a whole bunch of horizontal

37
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,159
lines of visual information.

38
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,229
To save space and produce a clear picture,
early home video technologies used an interlaced

39
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:07,829
format to compress the signal.

40
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:12,340
In interlaced formats, when a video is played
back, it displays sets of every other horizontal

41
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,400
line in a given image, leaving the others
blank.

42
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,280
Each of these sets is called a field.

43
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,620
First, a field with the odd-numbered lines
is shown, then an even one.

44
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,120
Odd, even, odd even...

45
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,180
Odd, even, odd even oddevenoddeven.

46
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,790
If you speed up that process until you’re
flashing alternating fields 25 or 30 times

47
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,620
a second, your eye doesn’t distinguish between
the lines.

48
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,340
Instead – thanks to the Phi Phenomenon – you
see a moving image.

49
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,819
While interlaced video allowed for some pretty
clear pictures, it doesn’t handle fast motion

50
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,879
very well, and the image tends to blur or
strobe.

51
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,400
It also gets weird around plaid or striped
shirts.

52
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,090
Now, Beta’s main competition was another
Japanese technology called the Video Home

53
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,210
System or VHS.

54
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:50,290
It was essentially the same idea as Beta,
except it was lighter, cheaper, and one cassette

55
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,819
could hold a two-hour movie.

56
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:54,840
So in the ensuing “video format wars,”
Beta couldn’t compete.

57
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,200
By 1980, the VHS format dominated 60 percent
of the U.S. market.

58
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,720
I think my grandfather died in the video format wars.

59
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,420
And that market was getting bigger and bigger!

60
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:08,440
As more home video technologies were emerging
and dropping in price, an enormous, untapped

61
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,670
revenue stream opened up for the Hollywood
studios.

62
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:16,010
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, more people
began buying Video Cassette Recorders or VCRs.

63
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:19,570
Not only could these devices play home movies
recorded with consumer video cameras, but

64
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,220
they could also record TV programs and play
videotapes of feature films.

65
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,140
Suddenly, people could watch Hollywood movies
at home whenever they wanted.

66
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,020
Kind of.

67
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,120
At first, it was way too expensive for the
average consumer to buy a video cassette

68
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,120
of a Hollywood film.

69
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,819
The studios charged between 80 and 90 dollars per tape! ...WHAT!?!?!

70
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:37,650
But rental chains could buy them in bulk,
and rent them out to the general public for

71
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,650
a few dollars a night.

72
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:39,650
Plus late fees.

73
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,129
These rental chains – places like Blockbuster
Video or Hollywood Video – along with independent

74
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:46,230
mom-and-pop stores, flourished throughout
the 1980s and ‘90s.

75
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,380
Film studios started going through their film
libraries and releasing old movies on home

76
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,720
video formats as well as new ones, making
money hand over fist.

77
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,410
As this new home video market matured in the
1980s, a number of film companies decided

78
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:00,470
they could bypass the theatrical distribution
system altogether and market their films straight

79
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,470
to the consumer.

80
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,129
The most successful direct-to-video films
fell into a few main categories: inexpensive

81
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:09,630
action movies, steamy thrillers, sequels to
successful theatrical films, and family films

82
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,500
– both animated and live-action.

83
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,890
Like low-budget B-movies, direct-to-video
films were often viewed as cheap knock-offs,

84
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,519
as opposed to “real” movies that played
in movie theaters.

85
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,110
Movies like Nail Gun Massacre, Death Spa,
or Rock ‘n’ Roll Nightmare were pretty

86
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,830
terrible, but offered a bit of good schlocky
fun.

87
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,790
Direct-to-video also gave film franchises
who were dragging a bit at the box office

88
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,290
a chance to stay alive with cheaper budgets.

89
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,280
Beethoven, I’m looking
at you.

90
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,720
Not the composer, the movie about a dog.

91
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,220
Now, back in the late ‘70s, as the first

92
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,620
consumer home video formats were coming out,
LaserDisc also emerged.

93
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:42,580
Rather than recording images on magnetic tape,
LaserDisc was an optical format, which encodes

94
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,190
binary data with a laser.

95
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,300
It’s a technology that eventually led to
CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray Discs.

96
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,900
Even though the picture quality was superior
to either Beta or VHS, LaserDisc

97
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,560
was ultimately doomed.

98
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:55,670
The discs themselves were cumbersome and fragile,
the players were expensive, and you couldn’t

99
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,140
record TV shows on them.

100
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:02,350
But by the time Digital Video Discs, or DVDs,
arrived in 1995, consumers were primed for

101
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,380
a technological revolution.

102
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,190
See, in 1987, Paramount Pictures tried an
experiment.

103
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:10,950
They offered the VHS cassette of Top Gun for
just 30 dollars instead of 80 or 90.

104
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,060
And it was a runaway hit.

105
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,040
...who knew people liked to pay less for things?

106
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,620
Almost immediately, other studios followed
Paramount’s lead.

107
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:21,770
And by the early 1990s, people could afford
to build their very own home video libraries.

108
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:24,190
One issue with VHS tapes is that they degrade
over time.

109
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,060
The more you watch them, the more the actual
tape wears down,

110
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,380
eventually rendering them un-viewable.

111
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,100
...like me!

112
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,680
In part, that's because VHS is an analog

113
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,240
technology, while DVD is digital.

114
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,580
Both analog and digital technologies transmit
information, usually through electric signals.

115
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:41,320
One of the main differences is that analog
technologies translate information into electric

116
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,221
pulses of varying amplitudes, while digital
technologies translate information into a

117
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:49,190
binary format made of ones and zeros, which
represent discrete amplitudes.

118
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:52,721
DVDs, like most digital technologies, don’t
degrade like VHS tapes.

119
00:05:52,721 --> 00:05:55,260
The ones are always ones, and the zeroes are
always zeroes.

120
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,080
So, the signal will always look the same.

121
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,700
Unless you’re at your parents’ house where
it will always look green and squished.

122
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,220
C’mon mom and dad, fix your tv settings!

123
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,280
The durability of DVDs, mixed with an impressive
increase in storage capacity, made them an

124
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,500
extremely attractive upgrade from video cassettes.

125
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,320
With all that extra storage space, home video releases could come with all kinds of fun extras.

126
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,200
Like: trailers for other movies, alternate
cuts and deleted scenes, isolated scores,

127
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,960
commentary tracks where the filmmakers could
talk about making the film, and closed captioning

128
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,570
that could be turned on or off.

129
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:24,390
Along with new releases, distribution companies
could repackage their old libraries with DVD

130
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,710
special features and make even more money!

131
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,250
These days, newer technologies have started
to replace DVDs.

132
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,640
Like Blu-ray Discs and Blu-ray Players, which were first made available to the public in 2006.

133
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,480
Like DVDs, Blu-rays are a digital optical
storage device.

134
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,750
But unlike DVDs, they can hold full high-definition
– and ultra-high-definition – video signals.

135
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,650
Now, when we talk about standard-, high-,
and ultra-high-definition video, we’re talking

136
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,970
about those horizontal lines that make up
the image.

137
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,510
The more lines, the clearer the image – up
to a point.

138
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:53,580
We label the level of definition each signal
has with the number of horizontal lines, like

139
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,980
720 or 1080.

140
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,260
That number is then followed by an ‘i’
or a ‘p’, indicating if the video fields

141
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,940
are interlaced or progressive.

142
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,440
Developed as an alternative to interlaced
video, the progressive scan format flashes

143
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,340
all the horizontal lines of picture information,
instead of alternating sets of lines.

144
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,590
Everything from the camera to the television
requires a much larger bandwidth to handle

145
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:14,460
progressive scan, but any motion on screen
appears smoother and more realistic.

146
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,560
...Like this.

147
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,480
So, standard-definition video has 480 horizontal

148
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,920
lines per image and is interlaced, so you’ll
see it written as 480i.

149
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,300
Broadcast high-definition refers to video
signals that have 720 lines per image, either

150
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,660
interlaced or progressive.

151
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,770
High-definition, or HD, has 1080 lines, either
interlaced or progressive.

152
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:38,020
And ultra-high definition, also sometimes
known as 4K, boasts a whopping 2160 lines!

153
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,650
That's a lot of lines!

154
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:43,980
Most Hollywood films shot digitally are being
filmed in 6k and and even 8k…

155
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,160
that’s a lot of k!

156
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,700
And when we're talking about 'k' we're talking about these lines... vertical lines.

157
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,160
Today, we think of Blu-rays as the main high
definition discs on the markelt.

158
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,720
When they were first being sold in 2006, though,
they came in second to their competition:

159
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,100
the HD-DVD.

160
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,820
The home video industry split between the
two formats, with companies like Sony, Panasonic,

161
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,950
Samsung, and Dell advocating for Blu-rays,
while Toshiba, Microsoft, and Intel supported

162
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,960
HD-DVDs.

163
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,210
For two years the conflict hamstrung the industry,
until Sony decided to incorporate a Blu-ray

164
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:13,430
Player into the Playstation 3. Very clever, Sony.

165
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,620
That was seen as the turning point in the
“HD format wars,” and by 2008 we stopped

166
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,630
making HD-DVDs altogether.

167
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:22,160
My Grandmother died in the HD Format Wars.

168
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,220
And the newest frontier in home video formats

169
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,420
is the 4K Ultra-HD Disc.

170
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,120
You just need a new player and a 4K TV to
watch one.

171
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,580
But if you're watching this video 5 years from now, we sound very old.

172
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,640
Now, the other technological and cultural
revolution in home video was streaming services,

173
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,559
which did away with physical discs entirely.

174
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:43,430
Today, streaming services like Netflix, Hulu,
Amazon, YouTube, iTunes, and Vimeo distribute

175
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,160
films and television programs directly to
consumers.

176
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,660
YouTube? Never heard of it.

177
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,260
They’re even making their own original content.

178
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,030
Netflix and Amazon produced and distributed
TV series and films that have won the highest

179
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,280
awards at the Emmys, Golden Globes, and Oscars!

180
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,800
These services also provide non-traditional
and independent filmmakers with a more level

181
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,180
playing field when it comes to distributing
their unique visions.

182
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,560
There are some drawbacks to streaming distribution.

183
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,800
You need a robust, consistent Internet connection to watch anything.

184
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,240
Not to mention, the content you’re looking
for may not always be available, unless you’ve

185
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,520
purchased and downloaded it.

186
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,400
And even then, you still don’t have a physical
copy to keep on your bookshelf.

187
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,180
Or sell later on Craigslist to make some money.

188
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,050
That said, there have never been so many
ways for films to find an audience.

189
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,280
You just have to look beyond the multiplex!

190
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,560
Don't look behind the multiplex. There's dumpsters back there.

191
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,380
And where the future of home video will take
us is anyone’s guess.

192
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:31,430
This is Crash Course Film History not Film
Future… so we’re not going to try.

193
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,960
But I bet it’ll be awesome.

194
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,630
Today we talked about 8mm film as the origin
of home video distribution.

195
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:41,410
We traced the development of the home video
market from Beta and VHS all the way to 4K

196
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,410
Ultra-HD.

197
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:46,130
And we looked at the impact of streaming services
on the production and distribution of films,

198
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,280
television, and other audio-visual content.

199
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,340
Next time, we’ll take a step back and look
at some unusual and captivating film movements

200
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,450
from around the world.

201
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:55,860
Crash Course Film History is produced in association
with PBS Digital Studios.

202
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,280
You can head over to their channel to check
out a playlist of their latest amazing shows,

203
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,640
like Infinite Series, Art Assignment, and Above the Noise.

204
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,830
This episode of Crash Course was filmed in
the Doctor Cheryl C. Kinney Crash Course Studio

205
00:10:04,830 --> 00:00:00,000
with the help of these video format warriors, and our
amazing graphics team is Thought Cafe.
