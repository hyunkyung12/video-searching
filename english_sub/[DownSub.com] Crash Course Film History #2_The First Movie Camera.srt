00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,600
Hello, I'm Craig, and this is Crash Course Film History.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,700
You probably know Thomas Alva Edison as the inventor of the light bulb or the phonograph,

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,900
But that's not entirely true.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:11,600
Gasp!

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,500
He's an icon of American innovation, and personally came up with dozens of new devices,

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,500
but he was also one of those guys with too many ideas to accomplish all by himself.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,200
Just like me.

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,300
So he hired a batch of talented assistants and put them to work

9
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,600
in the world's first industrial research lab at Menlo Park, New Jersey.

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,800
and with their help, Edison made some major contributions to lots of technologies,

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,500
including the technology of film.

12
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,600
Hey, that's what we're talking about!

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,180
One of those engineers was a young man named William, also known as W.K.L Dickson,

14
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,100
or, Wkl Dickson, as I like to call him.

15
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,600
His assignment was to create something that would animate photographs,

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,800
something Edison hoped would do for the eye what the phonograph does for the ear.

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,440
Within a few years, Dickson invented a couple of devices:

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,900
The world's first motion picture camera, and a peep-show style device that let people watch movies.

19
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:50,900
I love movies.

20
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:55,200
Just like that, film production was born, and audiences hungry for movies weren't far behind.

21
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,780
{ Theme music }

22
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,380
Before Edison and his lab had even built the viewing machine,

23
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,580
He applied for two preliminary claims with the US Patent Office,

24
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,340
one for his plans for the device, and one for it's name.

25
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,300
Thomas Edison, ever the patenter.

26
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,060
The idea was to create a coin operated entertainment machine that produced

27
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,400
images to go along with music or speech that played from a phonograph.

28
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,460
Edison wanted to call it the "Kinetoscope".

29
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,500
I would have called it the Coin-operated-entertainment-machine... o-graph. But, whatever.

30
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,800
For William Dickson and his team working in Edison lab, the pressure was on,

31
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,800
And there were a few technical challenges right away.

32
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,000
First, they needed to invent the camera to capture the images that would play in the kinetoscope, duh!

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,120
While Edison was on a trip to France, he ran into our old friend Etienne-Jules Marey,

34
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,300
Remember him? that guy with the chronophotographic gun?

35
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:46,900
Awesome!

36
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,700
who shot motion studies of all those animals?

37
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,300
Edison raced back to New Jersey and gave Dickson the scoop on the chronophotographic gun

38
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:52,800
Awesome!

39
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,500
And they decided to develop their own camera based on that design.

40
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,300
But, there was another problem. Rolls of paper film just weren't durable enough

41
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,100
to capture a long series of images and be played back over and over again.

42
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,000
After some experimentation, Dickson found that celluloid filmstrips that

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,740
were coated in light-sensitive emulsion did the trick.

44
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,039
It's a technology that's still being used today.

45
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,000
When in doubt, coat in light-sensitive emulsion, as the saying goes.

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,600
So Edison hit up his old entrepreneur buddy George Eastman of Eastman Kodak. Remember him too?

47
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,600
And Eastman began making lots of celluloid film in 50 ft rolls,

48
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,600
which gave Dickson all the material he needed.

49
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,700
The last technical hurdle was figuring out a way to stop the film very briefly and at regular intervals.

50
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,800
Their devices needed to capture and project a series of distinct images,

51
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,520
instead of an indecipherable blur, which is what you'd get if you ran a roll of film

52
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,300
straight through a camera or a kinetoscope.

53
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,900
So both the camera and the viewing device had to be able to grab and hold a frame of film

54
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,100
long enough for it to be exposed to light, and then move it along a grab the next one.

55
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,540
To do this, Dickson took one of those long rolls of celluloid film and cut holes along the edges.

56
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,200
We eventually called these "sprocket holes".

57
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,400
Then he fashioned an intermittent stop-and-go device inspired by the inner workings of a pocket watch.

58
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,200
This device was kind of like wheel with tiny teeth that grabbed the perforated film strip

59
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,800
by the holes and pulled it forward.

60
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,800
The teeth stopped for a split second, before grabbing the next set of holes and moving the film forward again.

61
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,000
This way, the viewer would see a sequential series of still images, that created that

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,400
delicious illusion of motion, as long as the stop-and-go device was moving fast enough.

63
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,700
In 1881, at the National Federation of Women's Clubs in New York city,

64
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,000
Edison unveiled his prototype for the kinetoscope.

65
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,200
It was basically a cabinet with a peep hole on top, so you can look inside and watch pictures move. Movies!

66
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,000
I love movies.

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And it was the first device which allowed for film exhibition, which is how a film is shown to an audience.

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,700
But, as innovative as Edison was, there were limits to his vision.

69
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,700
Unlike me.

70
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,100
He thought of motion pictures as an add-on to phonographs,

71
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,940
Which people listened to in their homes or at commercial phonograph parlors.

72
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,160
He didn't foresee the power of projecting film to a huge audience of people.

73
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,280
And he was exactly right. That didn't happen, ever.

74
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,500
In fact, some scholars think he discouraged Dickson from pursuing film projection,

75
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,300
which eventually fractured their relationship.

76
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,000
But for now, Edison and Dickson were chummy, and worked together to create

77
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,800
this pair of sister inventions, each with their own limitations.

78
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,700
The kinetograph was the first motion picture camera, which worked because they figured out

79
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,940
how to synchronize the shudder of the camera to a single frame of film,

80
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,360
using the sprocket holes and the intermittent stop-and-go device.

81
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,500
But it could only record images inside the studio,

82
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,600
because it was too big to haul around and needed electrical power to work.

83
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,800
No vlogs yet, but soon! Not that soon.

84
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,200
The kinetoscope, on the other hand, was a peep-show device

85
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,340
used to view the film developed from the kinetograph.

86
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,040
It could only show movies to one person at a time, and held 40-50 ft rolls,

87
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,040
so the movies themselves could only be about 16 seconds long.

88
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,399
It's basically the Twitter of movies.

89
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,999
And even though Edison and Dickson originally hoped to synchronize the sound from a phonograph

90
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,500
to the images in a kinetoscope, they never quite figured out how to do it.

91
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,800
In fact, true synchronous sound, or matching up sounds to images, would elude technicians for decades.

92
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,600
Now, some of the keys to Edison's success were his aggressive pursuit of patents,

93
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,560
and his interest in mass production, which was transforming industry at the time.

94
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,100
Even Henry Ford's large scale, relatively cost-effective assembly lines were made possible

95
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,400
thanks to Edison's innovations in electric power.

96
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,400
After all, something had to keep those conveyor belts moving.

97
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,700
In 1894, a Canadian entrepreneur named Andrew Holland opened the first

98
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,200
Kinetoscope parlor In New York City, charging 25 cents per person.

99
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,600
Edison got dollar signs in his eyes, and before long kinetoscope parlors were

100
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,300
opening up all over the United States.

101
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,000
People were lining up to get a brief glimpse at a moving picture,

102
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,500
as music played from a phonograph and refreshments were served.

103
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,800
Just like film exhibitors today, kinetoscope parlor operators made most of their money from concessions,

104
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,500
since they had to lease or buy the kinetoscopes and the films themselves.

105
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,200
Meanwhile, Edison was intent on collecting every single penny he was owed. Of course he was.

106
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,000
As more kinetoscope parlors opened their doors, more and more people were hungry for movies.

107
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,500
Crash Course does not condone or recommend eating movies.

108
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,700
Edison put Dickson in charge of film production, or, everything involved in the making of a film,

109
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,060
from writing and casting actors, to building sets and capturing the images,

110
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,200
Dickson was pretty busy.

111
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,200
And together, they built the first film production studio in the world, in West Orange, New Jersey.

112
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,880
They didn't really have to start from scratch, the space already existed,

113
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,100
because that's where they made the first films with the kinetograph.

114
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,800
But they poured more time, and just over 600 dollars into it, to make it a full fledged studio.

115
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,800
They covered the interior walls with tar paper strips to make the performers

116
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,720
stand out against the stark black background.

117
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,600
That, combines with complaints that it was cramped, stuffy and hot earned the studio its name:

118
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,800
Employees called it The Black Maria, after a local expression for police vans or paddy-wagons,

119
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,600
which gives you some idea how they felt about working for a guy like Edison.

120
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,300
And because the kinetograph needed a lot of light to record an image,

121
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,500
they built a retractable sun roof and a set on circular railroad tracks,

122
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,300
so that it could be spun around to follow the sun's light.

123
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,800
Did they add a hot tub as well? Would be nice, to have like a sun roof and a hot tub, that'd be nice.

124
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,000
William Dickson served as producer, director, and camera operator for

125
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,700
hundreds of kinetograph films from 1893-1895.

126
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,760
Most of them featured Vaudeville performers and slapstick physical comedy,

127
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,200
favoring movement over story.

128
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,480
See, the Vaudeville Circuit was the mass entertainment of the 1800s to the 1930s

129
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,000
before radio was widespread, and before movies came along.

130
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,900
Performers would travel together, set up shop at the local theater, and put on a variety show,

131
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,100
everything from music, comedy and acrobatics,

132
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,600
to sketches, trained animal and excerpts from stage plays.

133
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,700
People like Harry Houdini, The Marks Brothers, Bob Hope, and Buster Keaton

134
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,400
all spent time on the Vaudeville stage.

135
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,300
The most famous Vaudeville performers would only play the most exclusive theaters in big cities,

136
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,000
making it impossible for the far flung masses to see them.

137
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,800
So they'd have nothing to do. What would they do? They'd probably just sit around a punch eagles.

138
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,600
But with kinetoscope parlors, one star studded performance by, say, Sandow the Strongman

139
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,200
could be reproduced dozens of times as a seconds-long film.

140
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,300
That way, audiences all over the country could get a glimpse

141
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,800
of his bulging pecks and that sweet stache!

142
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,600
Can I do a... a performance? Can I do a Sandow the Strongman performance?

143
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,000
-No.
No? Okay, No.

144
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,300
Using Vaudeville talent had lots of advantages for kinetograph filmmakers.

145
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,800
Dickson had only 16 seconds to work with, and couldn't record synchronous sound,

146
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,400
so the performances had to be brief and interesting to watch.

147
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,300
Name recognition helped, as did performers who's acts were reliable and well rehearsed.

148
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,000
Just like mine. Right, Nick?

149
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,700
Plus, there were lots of them, and a steady supply of talent helped meet

150
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,500
the growing demand for content unleashed by the kinetoscope.

151
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,700
At least... for a while.

152
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,480
Because, as powerful an revolutionary as the kinetograph and the kinetoscope were,

153
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,000
their limitations threatened Edison's grip on motion picture production and exhibition.

154
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,700
I mentioned some of these earlier, but they're about to become very important. So pay attention!

155
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,200
First, the kinetograph was static, the camera couldn't move,

156
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,300
it was too big, and required electricity to run, so you could only shoot movies from one perspective.

157
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,000
Second, the kinetograph required lots of light, so it could only capture images well

158
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,360
when the sun was shining. In New Jersey.

159
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,700
Third, the kinetoscope peep-hole viewing system meant that only one person at a time could watch a movie,

160
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,100
which is fine if you're like me and you don't like to be around other people,

161
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,400
but not for everyone.

162
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,300
That meant a lot of waiting your turn to watch, limiting the number of costumers

163
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,200
a kinetoscope parlor could admit each day.

164
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,800
Finally, there wasn't any editing yet, so each kinetograph movie was just one single uninterrupted shot.

165
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,500
this wasn't nessecarily a limitation, throughout the history of cinema

166
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,100
there have been extraordinary films made from single long takes,

167
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,500
but until filmmakers could edit different shots together, the kind of stories that could be told

168
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,800
had to begin and end inside one brief shot.

169
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,600
Despite this laundry list of drawbacks, film had arrived,

170
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,000
thanks to Thomas Edison, and especially William Dickson.

171
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,400
Whatever else filmmakers were gonna do, whatever else movies were going to become,

172
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,600
this was their start.

173
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,900
Today we talked about two key inventions: the kinetograph and the kinetoscope,

174
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,799
that were used to capture and exhibit the very first moving pictures.

175
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,899
We discussed how the principles of industrial mass production helped spread their inventions,

176
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,420
altering the landscape of mass entertainment forever.

177
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:48,000
We introduced the first film studios and talked about how the first movies showcased

178
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,700
the action of swanky Vaudeville performers rather than stories.

179
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,500
And next time we'll learn about the first projected movies, and how entire audiences of people

180
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,600
began experiencing motion pictures together.

181
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,320
Crash Course Film History is produces in association with PBS Digital Studios,

182
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,700
You can head over to their channel to check out a playlist of their latest amazing shows

183
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,500
like "It's Okay to be Smart", "PBS Idea Channel", and "Deep Look".

184
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,200
This episode of Crash Course was filmed in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney Crash Course Studio,

185
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,300
with the help of these swanky Vaudeville performers,

186
00:09:12,300 --> 00:00:00,000
and our amazing graphics team is Thought Cafe.
