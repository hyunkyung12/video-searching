00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,000
Hi, I'm Mike Rugnetta. This is Crash Course Mythology and

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,860
today we continue our discussion of heroes and

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,480
heroism. This time we are looking at a hero king.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,700
Rama, whose story is told in one of the core texts

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,720
of the Hindu tradition. That's right we're discussing a living

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,360
religious tradition, Thoth and I would like to

7
00:00:17,365 --> 00:00:20,015
remind you that we'll be focusing on the narrative and cultural

8
00:00:20,015 --> 00:00:22,825
aspects of Rama's story rather than its religious meaning

9
00:00:22,825 --> 00:00:25,885
or potential historical truth.  Also, a quick

10
00:00:25,885 --> 00:00:28,460
note on pronunciation. There aren't any Sanskrit

11
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,200
scholars around Crash Course HQ, so we're going to do our best

12
00:00:31,205 --> 00:00:34,220
but I can guarantee that I'm not going to be perfect.

13
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:37,320
We've put the sources we used for pronunciations in the doobleedoo

14
00:00:37,325 --> 00:00:40,275
if you're curious how we arrived at any of what I'm

15
00:00:40,275 --> 00:00:43,315
attempting to say. Thank you in advance for all of your

16
00:00:43,315 --> 00:00:46,295
kind and helpful comments. So, who is this

17
00:00:46,295 --> 00:00:49,295
Rama anyway?  Rama is an avatar of the God Vishnu.

18
00:00:49,295 --> 00:00:52,025
He's brave, philosophical, and really

19
00:00:52,025 --> 00:00:55,500
good at archery, and also blue  which is very classy.  OH!

20
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,420
Very fashionable, Thoth

21
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,835
The story of the hero King Rama comes from an epic

22
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:12,085
poem known as the RAMAYANA. Like many other stories

23
00:01:12,085 --> 00:01:15,165
of antiquity, this one started as an oral tradition

24
00:01:15,165 --> 00:01:18,000
and was only written down later so there are a number

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,560
of different versions.  Today we're mostly

26
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,715
referencing the version recorded by the Poet Valmiki

27
00:01:23,715 --> 00:01:29,425
between 400 and 200 B.C.E. when the story was already at least 300

28
00:01:29,425 --> 00:01:31,725
years old. We'll talk about the

29
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:34,835
significance of this myth to the Hindu tradition but not all

30
00:01:34,835 --> 00:01:37,735
versions of Rama's story are Hindu

31
00:01:37,735 --> 00:01:40,615
He shows up in Buddhist mythology too. It's also worth noting

32
00:01:40,615 --> 00:01:43,195
that there's some debate over how well this story represents

33
00:01:43,195 --> 00:01:46,255
Hindu culture, values, and principles generally

34
00:01:46,255 --> 00:01:49,245
We're not going to do the same hero's journey blow by blow

35
00:01:49,245 --> 00:01:52,405
as we did with Gilgamesh but you definitely find plenty of those

36
00:01:52,405 --> 00:01:55,335
archetypal seeds.  SPOILER ALERT, there's

37
00:01:55,335 --> 00:01:58,385
at least 5 instances of supernatural aid, some of it

38
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:01,605
from monkeys and we are going to come back to Campbell later

39
00:02:01,605 --> 00:02:04,480
to ask "Who really is the hero

40
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,620
of the RAMAYANA?"  Keep that question in mind . Our version of the

41
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,199
RAMAYANA is a truncated version from thury and definies

42
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,255
introduction to mythologies textbook.  We start our story

43
00:02:13,255 --> 00:02:16,235
right at the beginning, from Rama's birth. His family

44
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:18,700
is really important, and there are lots of them.

45
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:26,000
So, it actually might not hurt to take notes. You got a pen? No? It's OK,  I'll wait.

46
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,600
Okay, ready? Let's do this.

47
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,040
Rama is born the son of the Dasartha, the king of Kosala.

48
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,875
He has an auspicious birth. The first of four sons,

49
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,905
after a long period of kingly

50
00:02:37,905 --> 00:02:40,915
infertility. And the king has three principle wives:

51
00:02:40,915 --> 00:02:43,945
Kausalya, Rama's mama, Kaikeyi, who

52
00:02:43,945 --> 00:02:45,885
gives birth to Rama's brother

53
00:02:45,955 --> 00:02:48,825
Bharata, and Sumitra who has twins, Lakshmana

54
00:02:48,825 --> 00:02:51,955
and Satrughna. All four princes are

55
00:02:51,955 --> 00:02:55,195
very princely. Smart, polite, they look real sharp in fancy dress,

56
00:02:55,235 --> 00:02:58,505
but Rama is clearly the princeliest. One day

57
00:02:58,505 --> 00:03:01,585
day the sage of the Vishvamitra comes looking for help dealing

58
00:03:01,585 --> 00:03:04,665
with the Rakshasas a group of demons, who were just

59
00:03:04,675 --> 00:03:07,445
genuinely bad news. Rama, who was old enough to do

60
00:03:07,445 --> 00:03:10,435
something about it, pledges to help Vishvamitra.

61
00:03:10,435 --> 00:03:13,505
He and his brother Lakshmana, assist Vishvamitra in an important

62
00:03:13,505 --> 00:03:16,545
sacrifice first, though. Earning top marks for both

63
00:03:16,545 --> 00:03:19,605
piety and general heroic character. Afterwards,

64
00:03:19,605 --> 00:03:22,335
Vishvamitra takes Rama and Lakshmana to a neighboring

65
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:25,255
kingdom, where they meet beautiful princess Sita.

66
00:03:25,255 --> 00:03:28,265
Her father, the king, had promised Sita's hand

67
00:03:28,265 --> 00:03:31,065
in marriage, to any man who can who can string

68
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:34,035
Shiva's bow, and no! that is not

69
00:03:34,035 --> 00:03:36,975
a euphemism. Shiva has an incredible,

70
00:03:36,975 --> 00:03:39,105
divine, massive,

71
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:42,475
bow, for arrows. So,

72
00:03:42,475 --> 00:03:45,595
here's where Rama really distinguishes himself. He not only

73
00:03:45,595 --> 00:03:48,595
strings the bow, he draws it with so much

74
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:51,625
force, that it breaks apart in his hands.

75
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,535
The king is satisfied, Rama and Sita are married.

76
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:57,675
Twelve years later, Dasartha decides to give up his

77
00:03:57,675 --> 00:04:00,575
throne, and names Rama as successor.

78
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:03,505
In a moment of familial, political intrigue, tho.

79
00:04:03,505 --> 00:04:06,395
Manthara, the maid servant to queen Kaikeyi,

80
00:04:06,395 --> 00:04:09,415
convinces her that her son Bharata, Rama's

81
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,815
younger brother would be a better king.

82
00:04:11,815 --> 00:04:13,545
Kaikeyi goes to Dasartha, and

83
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:16,525
begs him to fulfill the promise he made years before.

84
00:04:16,535 --> 00:04:19,084
Dasartha resists at first, but is stuck

85
00:04:19,084 --> 00:04:22,124
between his commitment. He makes Bharata king,

86
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,875
and banishes Rama to the forest, for

87
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,775
fourteen years. Rama, Sita and

88
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,575
Lakshmana, the loyal brother, head out together

89
00:04:30,575 --> 00:04:33,565
in exile. The trio go to the Dandaka forest, where

90
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,415
over the next ten years, they adventure like,

91
00:04:36,415 --> 00:04:39,105
woah! The defeat a demon named Viradha,

92
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,160
they visit a hermitage, they receive a magical bow, and

93
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,140
quiver with infinite arrows from the sage Agasthya Rama.

94
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,280
They even make friends with a celestial eagle named Jatayu.

95
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,620
who promises to watch over Sita,

96
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,765
whenever the two brothers go out hunting. Sadly,

97
00:04:53,765 --> 00:04:56,775
the peace doesn't last. The Rashasa's learn of

98
00:04:56,775 --> 00:04:59,295
Rama's exile in the Dandaka and send a fourteen

99
00:04:59,295 --> 00:05:02,245
thousand-strong army after him.

100
00:05:02,245 --> 00:05:04,905
Rama, armed with his magic bow,

101
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:07,965
defeats them all. In the face of such an upset, the demon

102
00:05:07,965 --> 00:05:10,875
Ravana, who has ten heads, resolves

103
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:13,765
to get back at Rama. The weakness he can exploit?

104
00:05:15,055 --> 00:05:17,425
Sita. Ravana orders the demon Maricha

105
00:05:17,425 --> 00:05:20,515
to change into a beautiful golden deer,

106
00:05:20,555 --> 00:05:23,505
and prance through the forest. When Sita sees it

107
00:05:23,505 --> 00:05:26,325
she is entranced, so Rama and Lakshmana

108
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:29,465
go out to catch it. With Sita alone, Ravana

109
00:05:29,465 --> 00:05:32,575
shows up disguised as a hermit. He proposes

110
00:05:32,575 --> 00:05:35,825
marriage to Sita, who refuses.

111
00:05:35,825 --> 00:05:38,785
Dadoy. Ravana then reveals his true

112
00:05:38,785 --> 00:05:41,405
form and swipes her, carrying her off

113
00:05:41,405 --> 00:05:42,695
in his flying chariot

114
00:05:43,075 --> 00:05:46,105
all Sita can do as she struggles is drop bits of her jewellery

115
00:05:46,105 --> 00:05:49,005
to a group of monkeys in the trees below

116
00:05:49,005 --> 00:05:52,045
Hoping that Rama will figure out what has happened. Back in the forest

117
00:05:52,045 --> 00:05:55,135
Rama kills the golden deer and returns to find

118
00:05:55,135 --> 00:05:58,195
Sita gone. He and Lakshmana discover the wounded

119
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,060
Jatayu, who relates the whole story before...

120
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,820
expiring. Swearing to rescue Sita,

121
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,760
the two travel to seek out Ravana' lair. Their search

122
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,560
brings them to The Monkey Kingdom, where they meet

123
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,540
Sugriv, the Monkey King. At first

124
00:06:12,545 --> 00:06:15,495
Sugriv mistrusts the two humans, but after

125
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,515
reassurance from his Chief councillor Hanuman, he decides to give them a

126
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,020
chance.

127
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,405
So Rama does what he does best. Boss

128
00:06:21,405 --> 00:06:24,440
archery feats and Sugriv is so impressed that

129
00:06:24,445 --> 00:06:27,455
they all become friends. The monkeys are happy to help Rama

130
00:06:27,455 --> 00:06:30,525
rescue Sita but there's one problem: it's monsoon season

131
00:06:30,525 --> 00:06:33,505
which makes travel very difficult. While he waits

132
00:06:33,505 --> 00:06:36,480
Rama pines away for his missing wife

133
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,500
Finally, as the rains abate, Hanuman talks to Jatayu's

134
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,580
brother, the vulture Sampati and learns that Sita is being

135
00:06:42,585 --> 00:06:45,575
held in Lanka, far across the sea

136
00:06:45,575 --> 00:06:48,595
guarded by a group of titans and it just

137
00:06:48,595 --> 00:06:51,515
so happens that Hanuman isn't any old monkey

138
00:06:51,515 --> 00:06:54,325
but the Son of the Wind. So

139
00:06:54,325 --> 00:06:57,285
he agrees to fly across the ocean and help

140
00:06:57,285 --> 00:07:00,305
locate Sita. Hanuman arrives in Lanka only

141
00:07:00,305 --> 00:07:03,205
to discover a grief stricken woman in ragged

142
00:07:03,205 --> 00:07:06,635
clothes sitting beneath a tree in the Ashoka garden

143
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,500
It's Sita. He watches as Ravana enters

144
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,160
the garden and tries to convince her to marry him.

145
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:15,095
Sita rebuffs him yet again and he flies

146
00:07:15,095 --> 00:07:18,125
into a rage, saying she has two months to change her

147
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:21,115
mind or he'll slice her up, cook her

148
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,120
and eat her.

149
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,340
This brings us to the Thought Bubble

150
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,360
After Ravana makes

151
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,420
his threat and leaves, Sita is stricken with grief

152
00:07:28,425 --> 00:07:31,385
Her thoughts turn to suicide but at this exact

153
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:34,305
moment, Hanuman steps from his hiding

154
00:07:34,305 --> 00:07:37,095
place. He tells Sita he brings Rama's good wishes

155
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,120
but Sita baulks. What If this is Ravana

156
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,460
in yet another disguise trying

157
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,035
to trick her

158
00:07:43,035 --> 00:07:45,995
Hanuman proves who he is by presenting Rama's

159
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
signet ring

160
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,120
and offers Sita escape but Sita refuses

161
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,260
It's only proper that Rama be the one to rescue her

162
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,160
Hanuman flies back to Rama with this news

163
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,275
Rama is overjoyed to learn that his wife is safe

164
00:07:59,275 --> 00:08:02,675
So, he leads a monkey army  across the sea to Lanka

165
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,900
They battle Ravana's forces for several days

166
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,775
The struggle is dire. In the end it

167
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,960
all comes down  to Rama's awesome archery expertise

168
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,980
He finally slays Ravana ending the skirmish

169
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,300
Sounds like a happy ending, right? Well,

170
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,120
not exactly

171
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:21,015
when Rama sees Sita, he says "I have

172
00:08:21,015 --> 00:08:24,085
defeated my enemy annd avenged the insult to me.

173
00:08:24,085 --> 00:08:27,095
This campaign was not undertaken wholly for

174
00:08:27,095 --> 00:08:29,445
your sake; It was to uphold the honor

175
00:08:29,445 --> 00:08:32,345
of my illustrious family. Your very sight

176
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,804
is now painful to me. For

177
00:08:34,804 --> 00:08:37,614
no man of honor can take back a beautiful woman

178
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,720
who lived for a year in the house

179
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,725
of a titan. But Sita is undaunted. To

180
00:08:43,725 --> 00:08:46,635
prove her faithfulness to Rama during captivity, she says

181
00:08:46,635 --> 00:08:49,545
she will undergo a fire ordeal

182
00:08:49,545 --> 00:08:51,620
She has Lakshmana raise a pire

183
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,380
and enters the flames

184
00:08:53,745 --> 00:08:56,415
She is immediately taken up by the fire

185
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,535
god, unscathed, thus proving her purity

186
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,465
beyond the fire cast shadow of

187
00:09:02,465 --> 00:09:05,820
Thank You! Thought Bubble.. Rama accepts Sita
