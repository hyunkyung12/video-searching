1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,140
Hey there!

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,220
I’m Mike Rugnetta, this is Crashcourse mythology
and today we continue our look at mythical

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,300
creatures with one of the most popular beasts
of all time: [[[Thoth stands up very straight.]]]

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,300
Dragons!

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,480
Aaaand also serpents – but mostly DRAGONS!

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,510
[[[Thoth slightly disappointed.]]]

7
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:21,369
Hide your thatched roofed cottages and get
ready for some burninating.

8
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:28,960
Intro
To talk about dragons, we gotta start with

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,960
snakes.

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,329
In myth, snakes often serve a function similar
to more terrifying creatures.

11
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:36,260
They’re etymologically similar, too.

12
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,579
In fact, the Latin word draco is used for
both dragons and snakes.

13
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:44,040
In the Judeo Christian tradition, the most
important serpent is that apple-shilling,

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,289
well… snake... from the garden of Eden.

15
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:52,929
Fun fact: he didn’t really start out as
a snake; he had legs until the Lord punished

16
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:55,480
him by making him slither on his belly.

17
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,070
No more scampering for that guy.

18
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:01,480
In the Babylonian stories of creation, we
learn about the enormous snake Tiamat, which

19
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,510
we’ve mentioned before.

20
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:07,590
Across the Ancient Near East, we find a number
of snakes associated with goddesses: Ishtar

21
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,520
in Mesopotamia, Wadjet in Egypt, and even
Athena in Greece, when she wasn’t hanging

22
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,570
out with owls.

23
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:18,020
Somewhere along the way snakes start sort
of morphing into dragons.

24
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,020
Not…

25
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,020
literally.

26
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,020
That would be dope tho.

27
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,020
I mean in their stories.

28
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,549
Babylon had guardian dragons called Mušḫuššu,
with a serpent’s head and body, the front

29
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:30,409
feet of a lion and a poisonous scorpion’s
tail.

30
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:35,939
In Biblical Babylon, king Nebuchadnezzar kept
a dragon in the temple of the god Bel and

31
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:39,710
suggested that Daniel, a noble youth of Jerusalem,
worship it.

32
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:44,299
Daniel said that he preferred to worship the
Lord and that he could kill the dragon even

33
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:45,610
without a weapon.

34
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:53,219
Daniel killed it by feeding it cakes of boiled
pitch, fat and hair, which made it explode.

35
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:56,899
For this mess, the king threw Daniel into
the lion’s den.

36
00:01:56,899 --> 00:02:02,409
In the Persian Book of Kings, the hero Rostam
kills a dragon that can make itself invisible.

37
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:05,450
He does this with the help of his trusty horse,
Rakhsh.

38
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:09,979
According to the long epic poem: “when Rakhsh
saw the strength of its massive body bearing

39
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:16,430
down on Rostam, he laid back his ears and
sank his teeth into the dragon’s shoulders.

40
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:23,120
He tore at the dragon’s flesh, and the lion-like
Rostam was astonished at his ferocity.”

41
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,120
Dragons play a significant role in Welsh mythology,
as well.

42
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,090
Wales even has a red dragon on its flag.

43
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:34,540
And this isn’t just any dragon -- it appears
in the nation’s cultural epic, the Mabinogion.

44
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,650
Ages ago the red dragon was living peacefully
on the British Isles.

45
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:46,270
And then one day, an all-white dragon invades
and attempts to seize control of Britain.

46
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:51,750
The red dragon defends its territory, and
the two become locked in a fierce battle.

47
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,060
The noise of their fighting is terrible!

48
00:02:54,060 --> 00:03:01,090
It causes crops to fail and women to miscarry,
so the British king Lludd digs a huge pit

49
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,250
and fills it with mead.

50
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,180
Turns out dragons, at least British ones,
can’t resist mead.

51
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,989
And so they drink the pit dry and fall into
a deep sleep.

52
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:16,239
With the two beasts unconscious, Ludd and
his men rush to imprison them.

53
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,879
Over in England, St. George is famous for
slaying a dragon, though the story takes place

54
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,660
in Silene, likely modern-day Libya.

55
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:28,780
There, the country is being tormented by a
dragon, and the only way to appease it is

56
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,640
to sacrifice a sheep and a virgin ... every
day.

57
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,489
And this goes on for quite some time, but
when the King’s daughter is the chosen virgin,

58
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:40,020
St. George appears.

59
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,390
Seems like maybe he could have shown up a
little bit earlier, but in any case he’s

60
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,390
here now.

61
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,450
He charges the dragon and wounds it with a
lance.

62
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:53,040
Then, he asks the princess for her garter
and throws it around the dragon’s neck.

63
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,480
After this, the dragon is so docile that it
follows the princess back to the capital where

64
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:05,189
St. George kills it in the town square after
making all of the people promise to convert

65
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:06,360
to Christianity.

66
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,939
Man sometimes mythological stories feel a
LOT like mad libs…

67
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:19,769
GEORGE defeated a DRAGON with a GARTER and
got the PEASANTS to respect MY BUTT-HEY, STAN.

68
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:20,769
COME ON.

69
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:24,550
Nearby, in Germany, we meet another famous
dragon, Fafnir, who actually started out life

70
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,280
... as a dwarf prince.

71
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,580
In German mythology, Fafnir and his brother
Regin kill their father, the dwarf king, to

72
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,970
steal his gold.

73
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,780
Then Fafnir takes the gold from his brother
and turns into a dragon to guard it.

74
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:42,840
Fafnir is killed and his crimes are avenged
by the great hero Sigurd (AKA Siegfried).

75
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:48,190
No word on whether he used a giant ice spear
or brought Fafnir back to life as Ice Fafnir.

76
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:53,280
Also, QUICK ASIDE: if you’ve pulled a caper
that requires you to transform into a dragon,

77
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,600
things probably AREN’T gonna turn out well
for you.

78
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,930
We can find even more tales of dragons, and
some of a slightly different variety, by moving

79
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:00,930
to Asia.

80
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:05,370
According to Lihui Yang and Deming An, authors
of the Handbook of Chinese Mythology, the

81
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:12,340
dragon “is the controller of the rain, the
river, the sea and all other kinds of water;

82
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:18,870
symbol of divine power and energy; great helper
of heroes; and bearer of gods and demigods.”

83
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:23,940
To see these Chinese Dragons in action, we’re
going look at a story of creation for dragons

84
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,840
and humanity alike in the Thoughtbubble.

85
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,410
Long ago, the earth was divided into five
parts.

86
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:34,000
Birds lived in the east, ruled by the phoenix.

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,060
Beasts lived in the south under their king
the tiger.

88
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,590
The west was home to insects, ruled by the
bee.

89
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:46,620
And the north was occupied by fishes and shrimp
under the benign rule of the giant turtle.

90
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:52,240
A monkey, with six arms and three heads, lived
in the center.

91
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:58,210
And one by one the kings of the other four
regions would visit this monkey and have sex

92
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,210
with her.

93
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:03,350
Eventually, the monkey became pregnant and
after 9,900 years she gave birth to ninety-nine

94
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,350
eggs.

95
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:10,030
All of the eggs, except the biggest one, were
stolen by the kings of the other four realms.

96
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:14,650
The monkey guarded that last egg until it
hatched.

97
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,400
Out of this egg came ... the python.

98
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,530
His mother ordered him to retrieve the other
ninety-eight eggs, and so off he went on his

99
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:30,450
quest, defeating and devouring birds, beasts,
insects, fishes AND shrimp that got in his

100
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,450
way.

101
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:35,780
But as he ate all that protein, the python
changed appearance.

102
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,240
He grew wings.

103
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,650
His head turned into a bull’s head with
deer horns and a pig’s mouth.

104
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:46,910
He grew hawk’s legs attached to his serpent’s
torso.

105
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:51,240
He became ... not a python ... but a dragon.

106
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,990
The tiger, the bee, the phoenix and the turtle
were so frightened that they returned the

107
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,570
other eggs to him without question.

108
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:04,450
The dragon then broke every egg in turn, each
one giving birth to a new creature.

109
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:08,470
All of them spread out across the earth, except
the last two.

110
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:14,900
Out of those emerged man and woman, and from
these two people all of the other humans were

111
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,900
born.

112
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,900
Thanks, Thoughtbubble.

113
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,000
So it’s been a while since we’ve had a
nice creation story.

114
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,580
Maybe you can see just how different this
dragon is from the ones in the Western tradition.

115
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:28,550
The deer horns and the pig mouth are… notable,
for instance.

116
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,120
Chinese dragons have lots of variation.

117
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,630
In some stories the dragon has a horse’s
head, its eyes are sometimes those of a rabbit.

118
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:40,580
Sometimes it has the scales of a fish and
the abdomen of a clam.

119
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,480
Sometimes tiger paws and sometimes eagle claws.

120
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:49,130
The Chinese dragon also has a special relationship
to water - which we’re going to see in this

121
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,130
next story.

122
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:55,960
Once, a black dragon is born to a poor human
family in Shandong province, which is a pretty

123
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,250
serious shock to his human mother.

124
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:02,530
It’s such a shock that when he starts to
breastfeed, she faints.

125
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,500
And I mean, can you really blame her?

126
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,820
When his father comes home and finds his wife
unconscious with a strange dragon baby, he

127
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:16,360
grows angry and hits the baby dragon with
a spade, cutting off part of its tail.

128
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,030
The injured dragon is so upset that he bursts
through the roof and flies away.

129
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:26,520
Many stories say he goes to northeast China
and settles in the Black Dragon River where

130
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,700
he becomes the river’s god.

131
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:33,429
He takes his mother’s name, Li, and becomes
Short-Tailed Old Li.

132
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:38,149
Years later, back in Shandong province, Short-Tailed
Old Li’s mother dies.

133
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:43,970
The dragon flies back to visit her grave,
which he does every year on the same date,

134
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,560
May 13, to pay his respects.

135
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,280
Each time he returns he brings rain, and so
from then on, he’s worshipped as a rain

136
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,280
god.

137
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,590
Throughout Chinese myths, dragons are associated
with rain and storms.

138
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,100
Wherever a dragon appears, there are clouds.

139
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,770
Because of this, the Chinese developed a number
of rituals to get dragons to show up, and

140
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,270
make it rain during droughts.

141
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:10,810
One of these is to throw a tiger’s bone
into a pool where a dragon lives.

142
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:14,920
Tigers are the enemies of dragons, and so
their bones should irritate them, causing

143
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,500
them to fly up wildly from the pool, thus
triggering a storm.

144
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,780
If you don’t have any tiger bones, you can
also try throwing your garbage into the dragon

145
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,780
pool.

146
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:28,860
Dragons are notoriously fastidious and their
inability to deal with the mess could force

147
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:35,070
them to bring rain and wash the pool clean.[1]
Dragons are also used as symbols of royal

148
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,070
power.

149
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:41,940
From Chinese Imperial Palaces to British heraldry,
kings love to see themselves as harnessing

150
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,420
the power of dragons.

151
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,200
The Japanese royal family even claimed descent
from dragons.

152
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,730
Daenerys Targaryen's claim to the Iron Throne
stems from her status as the mother of dragons.

153
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:56,900
And yet, there are important differences between
dragons in the east and the west.

154
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:03,210
In the west, dragons are almost always monsters
with fiery breath waiting to be offed by heroes

155
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,520
or gods.

156
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:10,860
Killing a dragon is an important rite of passage
for many western heroes, sorta like a violent,

157
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,210
scaly bar mitzvah with swords and fire breath.

158
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:17,020
But, in Asian myths, dragons are often benign.

159
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:22,340
Yes, they’re powerful and fearsome, but
they bring rain instead of fire, which is
