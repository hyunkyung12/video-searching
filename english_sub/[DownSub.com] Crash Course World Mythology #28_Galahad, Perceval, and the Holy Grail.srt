00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,890
Hi there. I'm Mike Rugnetta this is Crash Course Mythology,

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,940
and today we're going to talk about the Holy Grail...

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,840
of Mythology. Which is the actual, literal,

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,915
non-metaphorical Holy Grail

5
00:00:11,915 --> 00:00:14,985
King Arthur, Knights of the Round Table, and most importantly questing.

6
00:00:14,985 --> 00:00:18,035
The Holy Grail is always just out of reach,

7
00:00:18,035 --> 00:00:20,985
as the end of the road, ultimate goal

8
00:00:20,985 --> 00:00:23,935
the greatest adventure. And so the Grail quest,

9
00:00:23,935 --> 00:00:26,335
for whoever takes it, is a ready made hero's journey.

10
00:00:26,665 --> 00:00:29,705
No. Nobody. It's a grail, not a scale.

11
00:00:29,705 --> 00:00:32,505
Close though.

12
00:00:32,505 --> 00:00:35,395
In this video we'll talk about two knights who quested after that pesky grail.

13
00:00:35,395 --> 00:00:38,535
and we'll examine two things. First where's these stories depart

14
00:00:38,535 --> 00:00:41,435
from Campbell's monomythic pattern

15
00:00:41,435 --> 00:00:43,935
and second, how they combine the values of Christianity

16
00:00:43,935 --> 00:00:46,715
with the tropes and characters of pre-Christian myths.

17
00:00:46,805 --> 00:00:49,835
Grab your armor, and your coconut halves

18
00:00:49,835 --> 00:00:51,815
and let's quest for knowledge.

19
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,735
The legends of King Arthur and his knights had been retold endlessly

20
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,885
from the Middle Ages trough today.

21
00:01:06,885 --> 00:01:09,955
Many versions of the story contradict each other, or change focus.

22
00:01:09,955 --> 00:01:12,495
Historians even disagree over whether there was a real

23
00:01:12,495 --> 00:01:15,535
living breathing King Arthur.

24
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,415
That doesn't bother us though, because either way

25
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,385
the body of Arthurian legends remains incredibly influential.

26
00:01:21,385 --> 00:01:24,215
Most of the stories that make up Arthurian hero myths

27
00:01:24,215 --> 00:01:27,475
come from the late Medieval period, the eleventh to thirteenth centuries.

28
00:01:27,475 --> 00:01:30,515
They coalesced in what most of us would recognize as Arthur's Tale

29
00:01:30,515 --> 00:01:38,465
with Merlin, and Lancelot, and Guinevere, and all the rest in in [Sir] Thomas Malory's late 15th century stories collected as "Le Morte D'Arthur"

30
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:41,895
However we're going to focus on two other version of the grail story

31
00:01:41,895 --> 00:01:44,765
centered around two other knights,

32
00:01:44,765 --> 00:01:47,765
Percival and Galahad. To explore this paradigmatic

33
00:01:47,765 --> 00:01:50,985
legend of England we're gonna start in France

34
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:53,725
because the first time the Holy Grail appears

35
00:01:53,725 --> 00:02:01,985
as part of the Arthurian myth is in Chretien De Troyes, "Story of the Grail," a romance composed between 1181 and 1191 CE.

36
00:02:01,985 --> 00:02:04,405
De Troyes not only made his Arthurian tale

37
00:02:04,405 --> 00:02:05,540
about the quest for the elusive grail he also made Percival,

38
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:10,655
and not Arthur or any other knight

39
00:02:10,655 --> 00:02:13,595
the hero.  And Percival is maybe not the kind of

40
00:02:13,595 --> 00:02:16,665
knight you're used to.  He's a very brave young

41
00:02:16,665 --> 00:02:19,325
man but, he's not the sharpest lance

42
00:02:19,325 --> 00:02:22,235
in the armory. And it also turns out that his chivalry,

43
00:02:22,235 --> 00:02:25,185
and naivety play big parts in his

44
00:02:25,185 --> 00:02:33,945
hero's journey.  When our story begins Percival is living alone with his mom in the Waste Forest which sounds unpleasant, and

45
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:38,300
almost like a Fallout location. Percival is an only child to a single mom

46
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,805
because his dad, and all his

47
00:02:39,805 --> 00:02:41,745
older brothers were killed

48
00:02:42,265 --> 00:02:45,195
serving as knights. Percival's mom never

49
00:02:45,195 --> 00:02:47,985
tells him this.  She's all he has left

50
00:02:47,985 --> 00:02:50,915
and she worries that if young, not-so-bright Percy

51
00:02:50,915 --> 00:02:53,675
learns the truth, he'll want to be a knight and

52
00:02:53,675 --> 00:02:56,615
he'll get himself killed too.

53
00:02:56,615 --> 00:02:59,515
Mom's plan works, until one day Percy's out

54
00:02:59,515 --> 00:03:02,765
hunting, and he comes across five glittering figures on horses.

55
00:03:02,895 --> 00:03:05,915
They are literal knights, in literal shining armor.

56
00:03:05,915 --> 00:03:07,945
But Percy has no idea what a

57
00:03:07,945 --> 00:03:11,115
knight is, because his mom has shielded him from them.

58
00:03:11,115 --> 00:03:14,175
So he thinks they must be angels.

59
00:03:14,175 --> 00:03:16,985
Like I said, not the sharpest. Once he realizes

60
00:03:16,985 --> 00:03:20,105
they're not angels Percival starts asking the knights a ton of

61
00:03:20,105 --> 00:03:22,895
questions, like "Whatcha carryin'?"

62
00:03:22,895 --> 00:03:25,895
The knights look at each other like, "It's a lance, dude."

63
00:03:25,985 --> 00:03:28,845
Eventually one of the knights leans over to his commander and says

64
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:31,195
"Sir, you must be aware that all Welshmen

65
00:03:31,195 --> 00:03:34,105
are by nature more stupid than beasts in the field."

66
00:03:34,105 --> 00:03:37,105
Percy's not making the best first impression.

67
00:03:37,105 --> 00:03:40,025
Percial runs home and tells his mom

68
00:03:40,025 --> 00:03:42,575
all about the knights. She sees

69
00:03:42,575 --> 00:03:49,050
the writing on the wall.  She breaks down and she tells him the truth. Your father and your brothers

70
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,705
were knights and they died because of it.

71
00:03:51,705 --> 00:03:54,595
Percy's eyes light up.

72
00:03:54,595 --> 00:03:57,115
It doesn't seem like he gets the moral of the story.  He says, literally

73
00:03:57,115 --> 00:04:03,005
"I don't understand your words, but I would gladly go to the king who makes knights;

74
00:04:03,005 --> 00:04:06,045
and I will go, no matter what.

75
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:08,925
So off he goes on his quest

76
00:04:08,925 --> 00:04:11,695
never to see his mother again.  Right out of the gate

77
00:04:11,695 --> 00:04:14,645
he gets in a fight with a knight, and defeats him in solo battle.

78
00:04:14,645 --> 00:04:17,704
So, maybe he's got heroic talent after all.  Shortly after

79
00:04:17,704 --> 00:04:20,674
he encounters an old nobleman. In classic

80
00:04:20,675 --> 00:04:23,685
spiritual adviser fashion the old man teaches Percy a lesson.

81
00:04:23,685 --> 00:04:26,335
"Don't talk too much

82
00:04:26,335 --> 00:04:29,445
because you don't want to offend others.

83
00:04:29,445 --> 00:04:32,075
Percy takes this to heart, and you

84
00:04:32,075 --> 00:04:34,885
should too.  It's going to come back and bite him.  We're going to continue Percy's

85
00:04:34,885 --> 00:04:38,075
quest in The Thought Bubble. Percival next meets the Fisher King.

86
00:04:38,075 --> 00:04:39,715
Who is, you guessed it, a fisher.

87
00:04:40,695 --> 00:04:43,595
F.K. takes a shine to Percy,

88
00:04:43,595 --> 00:04:46,525
and invites him to a special banquet at his castle.  At dinner

89
00:04:46,785 --> 00:04:49,235
Percy finds out the king has been grievously

90
00:04:49,235 --> 00:04:52,375
wounded, and is on death's door.

91
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,125
None the less the Fisher King, a gracious host,

92
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:58,585
presents a sword he claims was destined for Percival.

93
00:04:58,585 --> 00:05:01,595
Suddenly a progression

94
00:05:01,595 --> 00:05:04,545
of squires parade in with all of these weird objects.

95
00:05:04,545 --> 00:05:07,435
First a white lance

96
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,380
with blood dripping from it's tip. Next, a candelabra. After that a maiden enters

97
00:05:13,485 --> 00:05:15,415
bearing a beautiful grail.

98
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:21,265
Psst... that's the Holy Grail y'all.  Everyone turns, and looks at Percy.  Being the good,

99
00:05:21,265 --> 00:05:24,215
obedient boy that he is, he remembers the weird old

100
00:05:24,215 --> 00:05:27,425
stranger's advice, and he doesn't say a thing.

101
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:30,595
Dinner wraps up, and Percival goes on his way.

102
00:05:30,595 --> 00:05:33,415
Everything seems fine, until he meets a

103
00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:36,505
damsel wailing and cradling the body

104
00:05:36,505 --> 00:05:39,705
of a headless knight. Percival asks what happened, but

105
00:05:39,705 --> 00:05:42,715
the maiden turns on him.  She asks point blank,

106
00:05:42,715 --> 00:05:45,755
"Did you say anything about the lance you saw?

107
00:05:45,755 --> 00:05:48,995
Did you ask any questions about the grail?" Percy explains, "Of course not!"

108
00:05:48,995 --> 00:05:51,525
He didn't want to be rude. The woman yells at him.

109
00:05:52,075 --> 00:05:54,975
"That grail has great power!  If you'd only asked about it,

110
00:05:54,975 --> 00:05:57,765
just one question,

111
00:05:57,765 --> 00:06:00,735
the dying king would have been healed."

112
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,765
She further explains "Hey, your mom's dead.  I buried her.

113
00:06:03,785 --> 00:06:06,865
Also, I'm your cousin. And also, also, you gotta suss out this grail thing.

114
00:06:06,865 --> 00:06:09,835
I can't help, I got more burying to do.  See ya; wouldn't want to be ya."

115
00:06:09,835 --> 00:06:12,845
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So, this is a lot

116
00:06:12,845 --> 00:06:15,905
to take in.  Getting told off by his cousin though

117
00:06:15,905 --> 00:06:18,625
is Percival's turning point.  He swears an oath.

118
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,265
He won't rest until he learns what exactly

119
00:06:21,265 --> 00:06:24,545
the deal with the grail and the bleeding lance is.

120
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:27,585
Such is the start of his grail quest, which lasts

121
00:06:27,585 --> 00:06:30,605
five years.  He has

122
00:06:30,605 --> 00:06:33,545
wild adventures, meeting knights, doing battle,

123
00:06:33,545 --> 00:06:36,740
and even learning a lesson about the meaning of Good Friday. This sets

124
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,360
up the particularly Christian faith based conclusion

125
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,995
of this particular tale. Because eventually

126
00:06:41,995 --> 00:06:45,115
Percival comes across a wise hermit. And after years of

127
00:06:45,115 --> 00:06:48,185
questing with nothing to show for it, Percy

128
00:06:48,185 --> 00:06:51,095
confesses his sorrow. It turns out the hermit knows why

129
00:06:51,095 --> 00:06:54,515
Percival has failed.  "Remember your mom?" He asks.

130
00:06:54,905 --> 00:06:58,175
"As soon as you left home she died of grief."

131
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:00,975
"That sinfulness is why you never asked

132
00:07:00,975 --> 00:07:04,015
about the lance or grail."

133
00:07:04,015 --> 00:07:06,785
And the man who was served from the grail? Percival's uncle.

134
00:07:06,785 --> 00:07:09,255
And the Fisher King?  Percy's cousin!

135
00:07:09,255 --> 00:07:12,205
He's been letting his family down left and right.

136
00:07:12,205 --> 00:07:15,195
The hermit tells him "You need to do penance."

137
00:07:15,195 --> 00:07:18,085
"Go to mass. Have faith in G-d. Take

138
00:07:18,085 --> 00:07:21,245
communion on Easter."  This is where Chretien De Troyes' version of

139
00:07:21,245 --> 00:07:24,455
the grail story ends, with Percival learning the truth about the grail,

140
00:07:24,455 --> 00:07:26,335
and thereby fulfilling his oath.

141
00:07:26,675 --> 00:07:28,575
You may have noticed all the standard

142
00:07:28,575 --> 00:07:31,105
features of Campbell's hero's journey.  Auspicious birth, and

143
00:07:31,105 --> 00:07:34,095
hidden parentage, damsels, and father figures, sages

144
00:07:34,095 --> 00:07:37,055
offering advice. But the grail never becomes the

145
00:07:37,055 --> 00:07:40,085
ultimate boon.  Percy doesn't find it.

146
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:42,235
He isn't even really looking for it.

147
00:07:42,645 --> 00:07:45,125
Instead he's looking for knowledge. "Of

148
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:48,125
the grail!" you may interject, but really about himself,

149
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,865
and the world.  You can also see how Christianity

150
00:07:50,865 --> 00:07:53,745
gets wrapped up in the mythical grail.

151
00:07:53,745 --> 00:07:56,385
Let's look at another version of this story from the anonymously written

152
00:07:56,385 --> 00:07:59,135
"Quest of the Holy Grail" A thirteenth century

153
00:07:59,135 --> 00:08:01,765
prose romance.  The story differs from  Chretien's

154
00:08:01,765 --> 00:08:04,575
in at least two major ways. First, the hero isn't

155
00:08:04,575 --> 00:08:07,235
Percival, it's Galahad. And second

156
00:08:07,235 --> 00:08:10,545
while Percival didn't know much about Christianity or

157
00:08:10,545 --> 00:08:13,615
anything for that matter, Galahad is a model

158
00:08:13,615 --> 00:08:16,465
of Christian virtue, especially chastity.  That's

159
00:08:16,465 --> 00:08:19,225
important.  This version has an overtly Christian

160
00:08:19,225 --> 00:08:21,725
morality, connecting the grail to the doctrine

161
00:08:21,725 --> 00:08:24,335
of transubstantiation, the explaination

162
00:08:24,335 --> 00:08:27,275
of how bread and wine morphs into Jesus' body

163
00:08:27,275 --> 00:08:30,385
and blood during communion.  In this story our hero Galahad is

164
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,855
the son of Lancelot, and Galahad

165
00:08:32,855 --> 00:08:35,794
is beautiful.  So fair

166
00:08:35,794 --> 00:08:37,254
and shapely a youth

167
00:08:37,255 --> 00:08:40,325
that one could hardly find his equal in the world.

168
00:08:40,355 --> 00:08:43,655
He's also crucially a virtuous virgin, with

169
00:08:43,655 --> 00:08:46,035
no fever of lust in him

170
00:08:46,035 --> 00:08:49,125
unlike his dad Lancelot. Sleeping with the Queen,

171
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,725
how disvirtuous.  Galahad's virtue

172
00:08:51,725 --> 00:08:54,825
marks him out for a special role that he's ushered into

173
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:58,065
by a spiritual guide. An old man who introduces

174
00:08:58,065 --> 00:09:00,985
Galahad to Arthur, and the knights of the round

175
00:09:00,985 --> 00:09:03,945
table. Galahad even gets a special seat

176
00:09:03,945 --> 00:09:06,885
reserved for the grail knight.

177
00:09:06,885 --> 00:09:09,495
It's called The Seat of Danger.

178
00:09:09,495 --> 00:09:12,455
(echoes)

179
00:09:12,455 --> 00:09:15,465
So Galahad sits in his danger chair, and announces that he'll take up

180
00:09:15,465 --> 00:09:18,520
the grail quest.  He proves his worthiness first

181
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,760
by pulling a sword from a stone

182
00:09:20,765 --> 00:09:23,615
echoing Arthurs miraculous feat with Excalibur,

183
00:09:23,615 --> 00:09:26,645
and again by defeating all the other knights in a tournament.

184
00:09:26,645 --> 00:09:29,695
At a celebratory feast the grail appears

185
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:32,695
in a vision, and miraculously feeds everyone

186
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,560
especially hungry, hungry Arthur.  Galahad

187
00:09:35,705 --> 00:09:38,220
and the other knights have many adventures, but the crucial

188
00:09:38,225 --> 00:09:41,255
turn comes when Galahad, Percival, and a knight named

189
00:09:41,255 --> 00:09:44,235
Bors set out on a self sailing

190
00:09:44,235 --> 00:09:47,275
ship.  The ship takes them to a small island

191
00:09:47,275 --> 00:09:50,215
where they find a magic sword, and Perceval's sister.

192
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:53,175
She says hi to Percy, and explains "This sword is

193
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:58,795
destined for Galahad.  To complete your quest you must take it to the house of

194
00:09:58,795 --> 00:10:01,855
the maimed king." Which is harder than it sounds, and

195
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,895
that's sayin' a lot because it doesn't sound easy.  It takes

196
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,775
five years of running around

197
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:10,745
separating, reuniting, but finally the three

198
00:10:10,745 --> 00:10:13,655
knights arrive at the castle of the maimed king,

199
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:16,855
Castle Corbenic, the castle of the grail.

200
00:10:16,855 --> 00:10:18,405
And who do they meet inside?

201
00:10:19,395 --> 00:10:22,595
Jesus.  That is not a joke.  They literally

202
00:10:22,695 --> 00:10:25,815
meet Jesus, who explains at long last

203
00:10:25,815 --> 00:10:28,635
the mystery, and significance of the grail.

204
00:10:28,635 --> 00:10:31,395
 

205
00:10:31,395 --> 00:10:34,455
 

206
00:10:34,455 --> 00:10:37,345
 

207
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,715
 

208
00:10:40,815 --> 00:10:44,095
 

209
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:47,225
 

210
00:10:47,225 --> 00:10:49,945
 

211
00:10:49,945 --> 00:10:53,175
 

212
00:10:53,175 --> 00:10:55,885
 

213
00:10:55,885 --> 00:10:58,895
 

214
00:10:58,895 --> 00:11:00,400
 

215
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,705
With the truth of the grail revealed

216
00:11:01,705 --> 00:11:04,275
Galahad continues to travel the land embroiled

217
00:11:04,275 --> 00:11:07,075
in various adventures.  ... However

218
00:11:07,075 --> 00:11:10,085
Galahad never makes it home to Camalot.

219
00:11:10,085 --> 00:11:12,865
Instead he ends up locked in a

220
00:11:12,865 --> 00:11:15,825
dungeon, where he eventually dies, and is

221
00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:18,865
miraculously lifted to Heaven.  So it's left to Bors

222
00:11:18,865 --> 00:11:21,455
to cross the threshold back into Camalot

223
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,020
and to tell everyone the true wonder

224
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,055
of the grail. Obviously there's more to these

225
00:11:26,055 --> 00:11:29,005
Arthurian myths than just the quest for the Holy Grail. We haven't even

226
00:11:29,005 --> 00:11:30,275
mentioned

227
00:11:30,765 --> 00:11:33,635
the incest, and there's a fair amount of incest.

228
00:11:33,635 --> 00:11:36,645
Still, the grail myths offer a nice paralell to other hero

229
00:11:36,645 --> 00:11:39,645
myths.  Miraculous feats, magical weapons, spiritual guides,

230
00:11:39,645 --> 00:11:42,695
and epic road trips.  In the end the quest

231
00:11:42,695 --> 00:11:44,745
for a particular object gets intertwined

232
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:47,745
with the articulation of particular religious and cultural values.

233
00:11:47,745 --> 00:11:50,295
Just like in the Ramayana, where

234
00:11:50,295 --> 00:11:53,245
adherence to Dharma is the real heroism.

235
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:56,155
We might also compare these stories to the Aboriginal tale of The Seven Sisters

236
00:11:56,155 --> 00:11:59,335
where the quest is one of self improvement

237
00:11:59,335 --> 00:12:02,395
rather than the pursuit of some external wealth

238
00:12:02,395 --> 00:12:05,195
or precious object.  For Percival, and Galahad the quest isn't

239
00:12:05,195 --> 00:12:08,155
about the grail itself, but the grail's meaning.

240
00:12:08,155 --> 00:12:11,265
Perceval isn't seeing a bejeweled golden chalice

241
00:12:11,265 --> 00:12:14,365
but the answer to a question he should've asked.

242
00:12:14,435 --> 00:12:17,065
Galahad too finds out the meaning of the grail

243
00:12:17,065 --> 00:12:19,655
which is what Bors must bring back to

244
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:22,645
the round table.  Remember, for Campbell and other scholars

245
00:12:22,645 --> 00:12:25,345
the hero's journey is a metaphor for any human being's journey

246
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:28,315
towards greater understanding of themselves.

247
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:30,525
Sure, these knights defeat enemies and save maidens

248
00:12:30,525 --> 00:12:33,695
and fight with magical swords, but they're heroes because of the

249
00:12:33,695 --> 00:12:36,155
knowledge they gain along the way.

250
00:12:36,665 --> 00:12:39,525
Which I guess makes you a hero for watching Crash Course.

251
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:42,605
Which we're mighty thankful you do. We'll see you next time.
