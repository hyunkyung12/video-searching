1
00:00:03,139 --> 00:00:06,859
Documentaries come in all shapes and sizes
– from the political urgency of Michael

2
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:10,830
Moore’s Fahrenheit 911,
to Werner Herzog’s meditative Cave of Forgotten

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:11,830
Dreams.

4
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,820
Some are funny, like Errol Morris’ 1997
film Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control.

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:20,429
And others are earnest and striking, like
13th, Ava DuVernay’s examination of mass

6
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:21,429
incarceration.

7
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:24,910
The best ones use many of the same cinematic
and storytelling techniques as fiction films

8
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:29,050
to explore their characters and themes, and
take audiences on an emotional journey.

9
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,930
And Otto Bell’s 2015 film The Eagle Huntress
fits that bill.

10
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:37,670
It tells a nonfiction story using traditional
cinematic techniques and ultra-modern equipment,

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,720
all without sacrificing the heart of the tale.

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:52,560
[Intro Music Plays]

13
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,640
Director Otto Bell found his inspiration in

14
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:57,700
a few still images published by the BBC in
2014.

15
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:02,120
They showed a young Kazakh girl in traditional
dress with an enormous eagle hoisted on her

16
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,699
arm, or launching into flight.

17
00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:07,659
Within a year, Bell had packed some gear,
enlisted a few crew members, and traveled

18
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:11,950
to one of the most remote locations in the
world: deep in the heart of Mongolia.

19
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:16,200
And what he found there was an extraordinary
character and an underdog story.

20
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,590
Now, during Crash Course Film History and
Production, we talked a lot about film as

21
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,470
an illusion of reality.

22
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:25,680
Filmmakers use the tools of cinema – things
like shots, cuts, sound, and narrative structure

23
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,390
– to trick us into believing what we’re
seeing.

24
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:33,330
The whole point is to make an audience feel
something, whether it’s fear, joy, or heartbreak.

25
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:37,070
A director wants us to experience the story
with the characters.

26
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,750
Documentaries are no different.

27
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,469
They’re illusions of reality too.

28
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:43,969
I mean, sure, the characters they depict are
by and large real people.

29
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:45,500
And the stories actually happened.

30
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,810
But documentaries use the same basic techniques
as fiction films.

31
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,690
And the best ones use those cinematic tricks
in good faith.

32
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:56,000
They might collapse time or choose out-of-sequence
reaction shots, but only in ways that remain

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,880
true to the spirit, theme, or subject of the
story.

34
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,020
In The Eagle Huntress, those film techniques
are beautifully harnessed to tell the story

35
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:09,008
of Aisholpan Nurgaiv, a 13-year-old Kazakh
girl living in Mongolia who dreams of becoming

36
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:10,008
an eagle huntress.

37
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:14,430
Eagle hunters have both a practical and cultural
significance to Aisholpan’s nomadic people.

38
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,470
Eagles are used to hunt game for fur and meat.

39
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,500
But they’re also used to compete in festivals
and competitions, where eagle hunters test

40
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,000
their horseback, hunting, and eagle-calling
skills.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,760
The film opens with sweeping aerial shots
of the mountains and plains of Mongolia.

42
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,090
These could just as easily be the opening
shots of a Lord of the Rings movie, they’re

43
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,090
so epic.

44
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,670
And in the first scene, we see an older man
riding a horse to a far-off mountaintop.

45
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,400
He’s there to release his eagle back into
the wild after seven years as his hunting

46
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,810
companion, as per tradition.

47
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,980
We sense this man’s deep connection to the
bird, as he offers it a final meal and then

48
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,150
rides off, never to see it again.

49
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,080
From there, we meet our protagonist, Aisholpan,
who lives with her parents and siblings in

50
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,269
a yurt-like tent.

51
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:57,379
We learn that she’s always idolized her
father and grandfather, who are both prize-winning

52
00:02:57,379 --> 00:02:58,379
eagle hunters.

53
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,970
She wants to follow in their eagle hunting footsteps.

54
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,020
Something relatively few women are doing.

55
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,879
And just like that, we’re on her side.

56
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,629
The film has given us a compelling protagonist
with a clear goal and obstacles.

57
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:11,920
We’re pulling for her, and her father is
pulling for her, too.

58
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,430
As he trains her in the techniques of eagle
hunting, he tells us, “I don’t want to

59
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,430
let her down.”

60
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,480
The film then introduces us to a group of
older, conservative, male eagle hunters.

61
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,590
None of them believe a girl should be allowed
to learn how to eagle hunt.

62
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,140
It’s a man’s job.

63
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,890
But they’ve never met Aisholpan!

64
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,950
She’s tenacious, hard-working, and – we’re
told – naturally gifted.

65
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:35,159
She’s also a 13-year-old girl, who takes
care of her brother and sister at her boarding

66
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,430
school, paints her nails, and giggles with
her friends.

67
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,370
In one of the film’s most thrilling sequences,
we see Aisholpan and her father track an eagle

68
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,040
to its nest, high on a rocky cliff.

69
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,879
There they discover two eaglets.

70
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:49,700
Her father ties a rope around her waist,
and she clambers down the cliff face to capture

71
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,080
her very own eagle.

72
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,370
From there, the training ramps up, until it’s
time for Aisholpan to compete in her first

73
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,530
eagle festival, which takes place in Ölgii,
Mongolia.

74
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,989
She’s up against men three, four, or even
five times her age, with years of experience

75
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:04,510
and competition titles.

76
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,879
And still, in event after event, Aisholpan
holds her own.

77
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:12,360
Her eagle even sets a speed record, flying
from high atop a hill to her arm in less than

78
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,500
five seconds.

79
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,089
Spoiler alert: against all odds, she wins
first place in the festival, raising her trophy

80
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:20,589
overhead in triumph, surrounded by a cheering
crowd.

81
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:22,129
It’s a powerful moment.

82
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,080
But it’s not enough for the chorus of elder
eagle hunters.

83
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,470
They’re dismissive, and some even change
course and claim that her youth and gender

84
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,750
gave her an edge.

85
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,550
Lastly, the documentary follows Aisholpan and her father as they pack up and ride off into

86
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,750
the snowy wilderness, hunting for a fox.

87
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,440
They work together, father and daughter, for
days.

88
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,910
And after several missteps and some seriously
deep snow, Aisholpan and her eagle finally

89
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,480
spot, chase, and bring down a wild fox.

90
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,130
In the film’s final moments, her father straps
the fox to her saddle and they ride off for

91
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:55,480
home, not just as father and daughter, but
as a pair of true eagle hunters.

92
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,400
The Eagle Huntress is a simple movie.

93
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,400
And that’s part of its power.

94
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,910
The film distills its themes beautifully and
presents such a winning and offhandedly-heroic

95
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,720
protagonist, that it feels easy.

96
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,750
But... it wasn’t.

97
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,090
Like, at all.

98
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:11,550
We don’t judge the quality of a film based
on how hard it was to make, but director Otto

99
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:16,470
Bell and his skeleton crew deserve special
mention for capturing the images and sounds

100
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,220
that bring this story to life.

101
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:23,290
First, they traveled to a bitterly cold, remote
region of Mongolia, and relied on very modern

102
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,890
technology to tell this story about a longstanding
tradition.

103
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:30,600
Relatively lightweight digital cameras allowed
them to travel and work in these far-flung

104
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
locations.

105
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Drones allowed the filmmakers to create tracking
shots, crane shots, and those glorious opening

106
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,590
aerials without the expense of dolly tracks,
helicopters, and actual cranes.

107
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:43,660
Mini Go-Pro cameras strapped to Aisholpan
gave us a first-hand view of her climb down

108
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,940
to the eagle’s nest and the first interaction
she has with her eagle.

109
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:50,880
Those same cameras, attached to the eagles
themselves, provided us a glimpse of their

110
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,100
point of view as they soared through the sky.

111
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,320
Second, they integrated themselves into the
lives of Aisholpan, her family, her friends,

112
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,720
and the older eagle hunters.

113
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,350
Aisholpan was understandably shy at first.

114
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:05,220
It took time and patience to get her to open
up and speak conversationally in front of

115
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,220
the cameras.

116
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:10,270
And third, they did it all while trying to
remain respectful of her culture.

117
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:14,260
Documentaries aim to depict real people in
real situations, but they’re still illusions

118
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,540
of that reality.

119
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,890
So these films bear a different kind of ethical
burden than fiction films.

120
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:23,160
And no one in The Eagle Huntress comes off
mocked by the film or filmmakers – not even

121
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,200
the old men who look down on Aisholpan.

122
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,150
They’re presented as wrong-headed and misguided,
for sure.

123
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,040
But it’s also clear that they’re grappling
with a changing world.

124
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,040
This brings us to one way to look at this
kind of film: as an ethnographic study of

125
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,620
a longstanding culture within the modern age.

126
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,420
The roots of this documentary film tradition
trace all the way back to one of the first

127
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,360
feature documentary films,
Robert J. Flaherty’s Nanook of the North

128
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,920
made in 1922.

129
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,000
Nanook took audiences deep into the frigid
Canadian arctic to follow the struggles of

130
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,610
an Inuk man and his family.

131
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:57,200
That film, however, has been roundly criticized
for distorting or even fabricating events

132
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,480
to make the Inuk culture seem more exotic
and out of step with the contemporary world.

133
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,590
In real life, the main character wasn’t
named Nanook, didn’t have a wife, and hunted

134
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,170
with rifles, not spears as the film shows.

135
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:12,380
By all accounts, The Eagle Huntress is a more
culturally respectful and honest film.

136
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:16,710
Rather than exoticize Aisholpan, the filmmakers
seem more interested in presenting her real

137
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,710
life.

138
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,720
By doing that, it actually makes this remote
culture feel familiar.

139
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,630
While we do see her in traditional dress and
riding horseback, we see her wearing denim

140
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,870
jeans and modern coats.

141
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,890
Her family rides motorbikes and trucks, as
well as horses.

142
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:32,610
And one shot even shows us a portable solar
panel that the family packs up with them when

143
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:33,610
they travel.

144
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:38,160
The juxtaposition of ancient tradition and
modern life is driven home when Aisholpan

145
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,740
and her father travel to Ölgii, the largest
town for a hundred miles.

146
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:46,250
A series of shots follow them riding horses
across vast empty landscapes, eagles perched

147
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,520
on their arms, dressed in traditional furs.

148
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,470
Then we see them riding into town, along roads,
next to cars, and past stores.

149
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,650
It’s as if they’ve ridden out of the past,
right into the present.

150
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:59,750
Which, by some interpretation, is how Aisholpan
functions within her culture.

151
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:04,200
She’s taking on the traditional practice
of eagle hunting, and doing it as a contemporary

152
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
woman.

153
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,310
Now, The Eagle Huntress has been criticized
for distorting Kazakh and Mongolian culture,

154
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,420
so it’s not a perfect ethnographic study.

155
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:15,330
Stanford historian Adrienne Mayor suggests
that this documentary may have focused too

156
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:19,120
much on making Aisholpan’s story seem unique
and filled with adversity.

157
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,410
Mayor points out that there were many female
eagle hunters throughout history, and that

158
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,240
there are several active ones today.

159
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,970
Women like Makpal Abdrazakova, whose story
has been reported on since 2011.

160
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:31,920
And even though the head-shaking elders add
to the drama and conflict of the film, Mayor

161
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,530
and others say that Mongolia isn’t a misogynistic
culture.

162
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:39,640
Even though Western audiences and filmmakers
might assume that of nomadic societies or

163
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,640
other countries.

164
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,130
Aisholpan’s parents’ constant support
of her and her passion for eagle hunting is

165
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:47,930
genuine, but may not be as unusual as the
documentary implies.

166
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:51,120
Other eagle hunters and people of Mongolian
communities have said that women were never

167
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,570
discouraged from this tradition.

168
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:56,620
And there’s evidence that women have consistently
had important roles and opportunities in these

169
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,620
societies.

170
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,590
So this could be a case where the director
had a story in mind because of what he filmed

171
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:03,640
and his assumptions, rather than what he researched.

172
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,310
And it led to a slightly askew portrait of
the truth.

173
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:11,650
Still, The Eagle Huntress works as a traditional
hero’s journey, and an examination of an

174
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,300
long-lived society in an increasingly modern
world.

175
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,710
Sometimes the simplest stories pack the biggest
punch.

176
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:21,110
It’s a beautifully made documentary about
a young girl who embraces her culture, works

177
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:25,630
to master an old art, overcomes her obstacles,
and – through hard work and fearlessness

178
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,529
– claims her place in the world.

179
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:32,120
And next time, we’ll make our way to Miami
for a look at the intimate, heartrending coming-of-age

180
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,940
drama and Best Picture Oscar winner Moonlight.

181
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,210
