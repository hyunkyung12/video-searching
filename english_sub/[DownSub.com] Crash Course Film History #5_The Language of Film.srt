1
00:00:03,159 --> 00:00:07,240
The earliest days of film are full of self-taught
artists, doing lots of experimentation, and

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,950
stumbling across many a happy accident. And some sad accidents, probably.

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,080
Nobody really knew what they were doing.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,910
They were making it up as they went, and audiences
went along for the ride.

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,230
At first, people was impressed by the sheer
technical marvel of moving pictures.

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,740
But thanks to Georges Méliès’ passion
for to dazzling illusions and tricky editing,

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,900
film began to emerge as a new medium for stories.

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,510
As filmmakers started to experiment with narrative
film, they began to establish a language through

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,529
different editing techniques and camera movements.

10
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:33,570
And with any language comes rules – things
like grammar, syntax, and punctuation – which

11
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,540
can help artists and storytellers communicate
their ideas in clear and interesting ways.

12
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,820
But before rules can be followed, or broken,
or mastered, they have to be discovered by someone.

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,400
And for film, that someone was Edwin S. Porter. And for Eagle Punching, that's me.

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:59,060
[Opening Titles Play]

15
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,260
Georges Méliès was a stage magician whose whole approach to entertainment

16
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,400
was to wow an audience with illusion, extravagance, and surprise.

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,140
So it makes sense that his films, as impressive
and influential as they were, operated as

18
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,390
performative spectacles.

19
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,270
This type of filmmaking is more interested
in presentation than representation.

20
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:17,130
We’re supposed to sit back in slack-jawed
amazement at the mysterious feats occurring

21
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,910
before us, instead of empathizing with characters
or “finding ourselves” on screen.

22
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:24,250
The film scholar Tim Gunning calls this the
“Cinema of Attractions,” and offers it

23
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,970
as a way to think about the entire first decade
of film – where the novelty itself of film

24
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,670
is enough to keep people buying tickets.

25
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,800
You’ve probably experienced this concept
at some point: a new technology comes out,

26
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,640
and at first we’re all just marveling at
what it can do.

27
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,830
Like, posting shaky vertical videos of your
cat online for everybody to see.

28
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:44,020
Or wandering around outside throwing virtual
Pokéballs at virtual Pokémon. Speaking of... GOT 'EM!

29
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,220
But eventually, the newness wears off, and
people want something more.

30
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,220
I havn't played Angry Birds in many months.

31
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,040
That’s what was happening in 1903, as mainstream

32
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,490
films started to focus more on narratives
designed to engage the viewer, rather than

33
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,670
simply astonish them.

34
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,830
And that’s exactly when Edwin S. Porter
entered the filmmaking scene.

35
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:03,271
Born in 1870, Porter worked as a sign painter,
telegraph operator, and minor inventor, before

36
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:04,780
becoming a touring projectionist.

37
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,669
He travelled from South America to Canada
exhibiting films for a device called the Projectorscope

38
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,109
– one of Edison’s competitors.

39
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,970
Part of Porter’s job was to assemble the
various actualités and short films into longer

40
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:14,970
feature programs.

41
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,660
He picked the order, created transitions between
the films, and arranged for any musical or

42
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,660
spoken accompaniment.

43
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,570
Now, this feels like a good place to make
a point about silent films.

44
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,320
Because there was no such thing!

45
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,420
WHAT!?!?!

46
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,200
I mean, even in the Golden Age of Silent Film,
movies were almost never shown in actual silence.

47
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,160
We call them “silent films” because the
technology to record synchronous sound hadn’t

48
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,170
really been invented yet.

49
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,480
But that doesn’t mean that folks gathered
in theaters, church basements, or barns and

50
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,280
watched films in pin-drop silence.

51
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,560
Larger venues employed full orchestras, bands,
or organists to accompany their films.

52
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,220
Smaller spaces might have had a piano player
or a phonograph.

53
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,000
Or a guy who went, "la la laaaa"... probably not that though.

54
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,860
Some films were even released with scripts
to be performed by actors, or voice-over narration

55
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,220
to be read along with the images.

56
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,950
So in 1899, after his stint as a travelling
exhibitor of not-so-silent films, Porter returned

57
00:02:58,950 --> 00:02:59,950
to New York.

58
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,569
He eventually became the head of production
at one of Edison’s film studios, responsible

59
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:07,460
for setting the stories, operating the camera,
directing the actors, and assembling the final films.

60
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,440
Wore a lot of hats, that guy.

61
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,540
This is where his time as a touring projectionist
came in handy.

62
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,980
Not only did he have a good idea what kinds
of stories and techniques played well in front

63
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,680
of an audience, but he’d also spent a lot
of time cutting together different pieces of film.

64
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,440
In doing this rough kind of “editing,”
he stumbled upon a bunch of techniques and

65
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:25,450
effects he would put to use in his own multi-shot
films.The most influential of these is called

66
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,310
parallel action or cross-cutting.

67
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,840
It’s an editing technique so powerful, and
which occurs in so many films and TV shows

68
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,959
today, that you probably don’t even
think about it.

69
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,240
Basically, parallel action is the idea that
a film can cut back and forth between two

70
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,440
or more events that are happening simultaneously
within the world of a film.

71
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,540
Even though you’re seeing these scenes in
sequential order, your brain understands that

72
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,990
they’re actually happening at the same time.

73
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,700
Like, imagine two parallel lines.

74
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,840
Each one represents the timeline of an event,
and both events are occurring at the exact same time.

75
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,840
Now, imagine slicing those two lines up, and
stitching a few alternating pieces together

76
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,319
into a single new line.

77
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,530
If I were to show you that final assembly
of film, your brain would intuitively understand

78
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,740
that these events were happening at the same
time.

79
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,740
Cool, right?

80
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,680
The first film that we know utilized parallel
action successfully was Edwin S. Porter’s

81
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,680
Life of an American Fireman, made in 1902
and inspired by Méliès’ A Trip to the Moon.

82
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,300
The story follows – spoiler alert – an
American fireman, who rescues his wife from

83
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,310
a burning building.

84
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,940
The film begins with a napping fireman dreaming
about his wife and child going to bed at home.

85
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,339
I love napping.

86
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:22,740
After a fire alarm is pulled, and the firemen
race to the house on fire, we cut inside the

87
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,669
building to see the wife and child carried
out of their smoke-filled bedroom.

88
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:29,990
Then, the film cuts back outside the building,
and we watch the same firemen enter the same

89
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,919
building and emerge once again with the wife
and the child.

90
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:36,260
Even though this innovation seems small, it
contributed to film grammar in ways we still

91
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,840
see to this day, and affected what filmmakers
thought was possible as they constructed their

92
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,930
stories for the screen.

93
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:45,590
Now, in 1903, Porter released his most successful
film: The Great Train Robbery.

94
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:48,870
Some scholars argue that The Great Train Robbery
doesn’t use parallel action in the same

95
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,920
way that The Life of an American Fireman did.

96
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,812
But I think a close reading of the film shows
a sophisticated understanding of how a filmmaker

97
00:04:54,812 --> 00:04:58,420
can manipulate time by cutting between simultaneous
scenes.

98
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:02,870
In the film, a railroad engineer is knocked
out and tied up by a group of bandits bent

99
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,990
on hijacking a train.

100
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,880
The heist plays out in a traditional, linear
fashion: Each scene is one uninterrupted shot

101
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,380
after another, including a really long shot
of the thieves lining up the passengers and

102
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,380
stealing their stuff.

103
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,560
Then, a remarkable thing happens... and I'm gonna remark on it.

104
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,250
Once the heist is complete, the film cuts
back to the railroad office, as a young girl

105
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,470
discovers the unconscious engineer, revives
him, and sets him free.

106
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:26,130
We then cut to a group of law enforcement
officers at a dance, where the engineer busts

107
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,590
in and alerts them to the heist.

108
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:30,690
And finally, we cut to the criminals riding
horses through the woods, being chased by

109
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,030
the law enforcement officers.

110
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,949
At this moment, the two time streams that
were happening simultaneously – the railroad

111
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:38,010
engineer’s and the criminals’ – suddenly
merge.

112
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:41,720
And the rest of the film plays out in another
linear scene in which the offers gun down

113
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,740
the criminals, dispensing the kind of frontier
justice that would make Clint Eastwood proud.

114
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,820
Contemporary films use cross-cutting all the
time.

115
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,740
Take the final sequence from The Godfather,
for example.

116
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,240
70s but, contemporary.

117
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,000
In it, director Francis Ford Coppola cuts

118
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:57,760
back and forth between the baptism of Michael
Corleone’s godson and the slaughter of his

119
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,210
enemies – church to bloodbath and back again. Fun.

120
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:04,560
This kind of parallel action not only shows
us events that are happening simultaneously,

121
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,729
but also connects them thematically and symbolically.

122
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:10,370
Michael is consolidating his power as head
of a major crime family through both violent

123
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,730
and peaceful means, in ceremonies both sacred
and profane, juxtaposing life and death.

124
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,449
Not every use of parallel action is as profound
as that, though.

125
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:21,110
Comic book blockbusters like The Dark Knight
or Captain America: The Winter Soldier cross-cut

126
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,830
during action sequences to heighten tension,
while thrillers like The Fugitive and The

127
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,560
Silence of the Lambs juxtapose the pursuer
and the pursued.

128
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,010
And every romantic comedy that ends with a
race to the airport cuts back and forth between

129
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:34,980
the would-be sweethearts, daring us to consider
the possibility that they won’t live happily

130
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,980
ever after.

131
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,270
All of that starts with Edwin S. Porter and
his experiments with parallel action.

132
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,680
Porter was responsible for a few other innovations
in The Great Train Robbery that made it one

133
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,190
of the most influential movies of the early
silent era.

134
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,050
Before The Great Train Robbery, most films
consisted of static shots.

135
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,760
The camera was set up, someone turned the
crank, and the scene played out before the lens.

136
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,759
Porter was among the first filmmakers to begin
moving the camera during the shot.

137
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:56,400
And that’s how we got the pan and the tilt.

138
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,889
A pan occurs when the camera is turned left
or right on a horizontal axis from a fixed

139
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:01,500
point, like the top of a tripod.

140
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,600
And a tilt happens when the camera is moved
up or down on a vertical axis from a fixed point.

141
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:09,419
Porter used both in The Great Train Robbery,
including one remarkable pan as the escaping

142
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:11,820
criminals hop over a stream and scurry through
the trees.

143
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,790
The camera pans left with them to discover…
horses: their means of escape!

144
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:18,290
The film and the filmmaker are playing a trick
on us.

145
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:22,580
They know more than we do, and Porter is revealing
narrative information in a camera move, instead

146
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,760
of just showing us everything!

147
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,680
He’s using the camera to tell the story. Amazing!

148
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,740
Here’s another chance to put yourself in
the shoes of an audience member: one who’s

149
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,210
only seen films where the camera never moved,
and all the story information was right there

150
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,210
in the shot.

151
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,170
Then imagine seeing a film where that information
was withheld and given to you piece by piece,

152
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,170
keeping you on your toes.

153
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,180
You’re suddenly watching an exponentially
more sophisticated film.

154
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,180
Lucky you.

155
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,900
Not to mention, the last shot of The Great
Train Robbery was unique in its own right.

156
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,420
It’s a medium close-up of one of the bandits,
much closer than any shot we’ve seen so

157
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,600
far – from about navel up – and he’s
looking directly at us.

158
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,350
He raises his pistol, aims at the camera – at
us! – and fires.

159
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:59,220
The size, scale, and direct gaze of this shot
was startling at the time, and influential

160
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,360
enough that Martin Scorsese stole it for a
key moment in Goodfellas.

161
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,760
And if it’s good enough for Marty, it must
be pretty good. Marty, if you're watching? Can I call you Marty?

162
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,600
Let me know in the comments.

163
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,220
No single filmmaker did as much to shape narrative
film grammar in the first decade of motion

164
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:12,889
pictures as Edwin S. Porter.

165
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:16,520
He uncovered a series of tools and techniques
– the first rules of narrative film language

166
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,310
– that subsequent directors would use, modify,
and expand upon for decades to come.

167
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:23,430
Prior to The Life of an American Fireman and
The Great Train Robbery, films were almost

168
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:28,820
all constructed in a strictly linear fashion
– complete scene followed by complete scene. BORING!

169
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:32,490
But after Porter, filmmakers became more adept
at telling stories, using shots and cuts to

170
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,769
engage the audience and keep them coming back
for more.

171
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:37,019
And in many ways, film has never looked back.

172
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:40,409
Today we learned about Edwin S. Porter, whose
experiments with editing helped establish

173
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:44,420
the language of narrative film, and expanded
the horizons of what filmmakers thought was possible.

174
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,820
We introduced the idea of cross-cutting, and
how our brains can understand when a film

175
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:49,730
cuts between simultaneous events.

176
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,819
Then, we discussed how Porter innovated even
more storytelling tools, like moving the camera

177
00:08:53,819 --> 00:08:54,819
in pans and tilts.

178
00:08:54,819 --> 00:08:57,999
And now that the foundation has been laid,
next time, we’ll talk about even more developments

179
00:08:57,999 --> 00:09:00,480
in film language and the emergence of the
feature film.

180
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,079
Crash Course Film History is produced in association
with PBS Digital Studios.

181
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:07,360
You can head over to their channel to check
out a playlist of their latest amazing shows,

182
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,579
like PBS Space Time, The Good Stuff, and Blank
on Blank.

183
00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:14,100
This episode of Crash Course was filmed in
the Doctor Cheryl C. Kinney Crash Course Studio

184
00:09:14,100 --> 00:00:00,000
with the help of these nice train robbers and our
amazing graphics team, is Thought Cafe.
