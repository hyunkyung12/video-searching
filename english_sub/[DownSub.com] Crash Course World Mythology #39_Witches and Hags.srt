1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400
Hey there I'm Mike Rugnetta.

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,100
This is crash course mythology and today,

3
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:08,100
we're gonna shift just slightly from our discussion of monsters to talk about...

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,300
Monstrous humans! Monstrous human women to be exact. We're discussing witches and hags.

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:20,540
Many, scary, magical ladies. You know what's scariest about them? It's their giant gross moles. Just kidding.

6
00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:22,800
It's their habit of turning people into stone.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,700
Thoth! Noooo!

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:32,640
(Cheery theme song)

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,700
Before we start, a quick reminder that many cultures which created these myths are patriarchal

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,700
and many of the stories we're going to look at are more than a little misogynistic...

11
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,659
devoting an episode to terrifying women doesn't mean we're endorsing the idea that women..

12
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:51,500
especially older wiser women are... horrible...

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,659
And actually in many stories, it's not even clear whether these women are really so horrible.

14
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:02,400
They may just be trying to protect themselves and their place in the social or metaphysical order.

15
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,200
Really! One myth's forest hag might be 
another's fairy godmother,

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,200
after just a little shift in perspective.

17
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,700
Anyway, just something to keep in mind while we're dissing on all these hags.

18
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,900
So when I say witch there's almost certainly an image that comes to mind.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,500
Many myths especially folk and fairy tales feature old women described as ugly or misshapen.

20
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,800
And with frightening magical powers.

21
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,400
There are a few exceptions but most witches use their powers for evil.

22
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,800
Depending upon the tradition which is
synonymous with or akin... to hag.

23
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,258
In many myths hags are magical old women who are responsible for giving people bad dreams

24
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:42,919
Some hags even sit on the chest of their sleeping victims

25
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,600
Sprinkling bad images into their minds.

26
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,850
In Norse mythology, the hag is called a mare or Mara...

27
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,180
And they come in the night to torment you.

28
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,400
A mare at night,  "A nightmare".
Get it? That's a thing, a nightmare.

29
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:00,000
In Celtic mythology, there's a hag called the Cailleach,

30
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:05,240
Who often appears with a staff and likes to make everybody cold and miserable.

31
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,579
In one Scottish tradition she comes down from her mountain home

32
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:11,719
On November first beats her staff on the ground and ushers in winter

33
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,700
But not all Cailleachs manifest such awesome power.

34
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,640
In one story the Cailleach is basically just a petty thief.

35
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,200
The story begins long ago in the parish of Kirk loanin where...

36
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,620
the widow, Ena McCarran lives with her three daughters Calybrid, Calyphony, and Calyvorra.

37
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,260
Their father having died years ago,

38
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,340
left behind a leather bag full of gold coins.

39
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,218
That Ena keeps under the hearthstone in front of the fire.

40
00:02:35,218 --> 00:02:38,700
The gold coins are how she provides for the family.

41
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,060
One day an old hag comes knocking at the door,

42
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,200
*whispering tone* spoiler alert she the Cailleach.

43
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,100
And she's a hungry Cailleach at that.

44
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,079
Ena just sees an old woman though, and she doesn't like to turn a beggar away

45
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:52,240
so she invites the Cailleach in for soup.

46
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,189
When she returns with a shawl to comfort the shivering old woman, the Cailleach is gone and

47
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,060
So with them with McCarran's stash - without their gold the family is hungry

48
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:07,220
Desperate eventually Calybrid, the oldest, tells her mother that she's leaving to make her fortune

49
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,500
and that if she doesn't return in a year,

50
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,920
they can assume that she's made it big.

51
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,120
Ena a bakes her daughter an oak cake for her journey

52
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,789
But before sending her off Ena asks for one piece of it in exchange for a blessing

53
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:23,900
but Calybrid doesn't know when she's gonna have her next meal so she refuses her mother.

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,109
Early in her journey Calybrid finds a house and...

55
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:28,627
Surprise! The Cailleach lives there.

56
00:03:28,627 --> 00:03:32,679
The Cailleach offers Calybrid a job as her maid, but only on one condition,

57
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:38,037
Never clean the chimney!
Calybrid agrees and goes to sleep.

58
00:03:38,037 --> 00:03:39,609
The next day Calybrid

59
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,730
Definitely looks in the chimney where low and behold she finds her family's lost bag of gold

60
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:48,189
Without thinking twice she sets out for home

61
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:50,901
So let's see what happens next in the thought bubble.

62
00:03:50,901 --> 00:03:51,668
On her way home,

63
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:56,200
Calybrid passes a horse who asks her to rub him down. Calybrid refuses.

64
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,600
Later, she passes a sheep who asks her to shear him. Again, she refuses.

65
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,198
Then, she passes a goat, a lime kiln, a cow, and finally a mill

66
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,310
Refuses them all. At this point,

67
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:11,340
She's so tired that she goes inside the mill and falls asleep.

68
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,000
In the meantime, the Cailleach returns home to find that the bag of gold is missing.

69
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,539
Running outside, she finds a horse "Have you seen a girl past this way?"

70
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:24,309
"I have", says the horse. The same with the sheep, the goat, the lime kiln,

71
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:30,700
The cow, and the mill who says "I've got her sleeping inside me, right now."

72
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,690
The Cailleach creeps inside and touches Calybrid's shoulder with a hazel wand

73
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,240
Turning her into stone.

74
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,009
A year and a day later the second daughter,

75
00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:43,149
Calyphony decides it's her turn to go fortune seeking and it's the same deal

76
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:50,500
Oat cake, no blessing, maid job, chimney, bag grab, horse, sheep, goat kiln, cow, mill refusal, falling asleep

77
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,560
And yep turned to stone.

78
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,800
Another year and a day later. It's Calyvorra's turn.

79
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,369
Unlike her greedy sisters,

80
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,650
she gives a piece of the oatcake to her mother.

81
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,800
She takes the job, steals the gold, gets on her way.

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,800
But when she comes across the horse,
She rubs it down.

83
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,820
She shears the sheep, and changes the goats tether,

84
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,869
Cleans the lime kiln and milks the cow.

85
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:15,030
She turns the mill and after all her hard work, she falls asleep on a sack of flour.

86
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,920
Presumably not noticing the stone statues of her sisters.

87
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,059
When the Cailleach rushes off to find Calyvorra,

88
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,900
She asks the animals and the kiln if they seen her and each one says, "No."

89
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,780
When she gets to the mill and asks if it saw the girl,

90
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,839
The mill catches the Cailleach in its cogs and

91
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:31,980
grinds her up.

92
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,480
Thanks, thought bubble!

93
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,800
The Cailleach screams wake Calyvorra

94
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,010
And the helpful mill..

95
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:39,780
tells her to pick up the wand and touch the stones in the corner.

96
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,969
As soon as the wand touches them they turned back...

97
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,560
into her very surprised sisters.

98
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,309
The mill then tells Calyvorra to touch the wand to the leather bag

99
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:52,260
And it will never be empty and then to burn the wand so it can never harm..

100
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,470
anyone again.

101
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,490
The girls do as they're told and return home to their mother..

102
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,060
with the leather bag.

103
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,909
The story contains a lot of familiar tropes of the...

104
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,580
dangerous and devious witch;

105
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,190
She looks like an old woman, she shows up on someone's doorstep,

106
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,670
she has a house in the woods,

107
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:10,640
And she has a magic wand that she uses for nefarious purposes.

108
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,749
And like monsters and other mythical creatures,

109
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,809
she's notable for her ugly wrinkly appearance.

110
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:20,159
It's kind of a bummer that old age is used as a sign of evil so often.

111
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,679
I mean I've met a ton of old folks and only like

112
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,340
Six of them tops were probably magical villains.

113
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,880
Another hideous old woman who is more than she seems is Baba Yaga.

114
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,650
And no, the story is not about John Wick.

115
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,959
It's about the hag of Russia and Eastern Europe.

116
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,210
But she's just as terrifying if you cross her, with bulging eyes that can turn people to stone.

117
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:44,600
Apparently, stoning people is like the go-to spell for old magical ladies.

118
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:50,000
Anyway, she lives alone in a birch forest in a hut that sits atop a pair of chicken legs.

119
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:56,120
The hut is surrounded by human skulls and each day the hut is visited by three ghostly riders,

120
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,300
One dressed in white, one in red, and one in black.

121
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,800
These riders represent the passage of time.

122
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:08,000
Baba Yaga flies through the night sky on a giant mortar that she rose with a giant pestle.

123
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,349
She wipes away her tracks with a birch broom and like the Windigo,

124
00:07:11,469 --> 00:07:15,360
she's a cannibal with a penchant for luring princesses to her hut

125
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,200
For...*awkward cough*

126
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,160
Dinner.

127
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,780
According to Brenda Rosin, some scholars believe that originally, Baba Yaga was a potent female nature spirit,

128
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,210
A provider of healing,

129
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:27,560
Protection and guidance.

130
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,938
In this respect she's similar to another terrifying female creature from Greek mythology.

131
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:37,090
The Gorgon, Medusa. This snake headed stone making lady may not seem to be much of a protector or a guide.

132
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:42,069
But there's one myth that says blood from the right side of a Gorgon can bring a corpse...

133
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:43,440
back to life.

134
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,639
While blood from the left side is...

135
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:47,120
deadly poison.

136
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,079
Turns out also, the name Medusa is related to the ancient Greek word for...

137
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:52,719
'protect' and can be translated as...

138
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:53,840
'guardian'.

139
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,760
So maybe she just has a bad reputation because of mean old Perseus

140
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,100
and of course her petrifying visage.

141
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,080
These three different frightening females are from different times and places,

142
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,705
but they have a number of things in common.

143
00:08:05,705 --> 00:08:08,600
They're hideous, ancient and dangerous.

144
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,480
One wrong move and you get turned to stone.

145
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,200
Hags are seen as monstrous because of their ability to transform themselves and others,

146
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,288
and their tricky conniving ways.

147
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:22,060
But perhaps they also reflect a societal discomfort with old age

148
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:28,659
Which works its own transformations on the body and cultures that valorize youth that old age can seem...

149
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,600
Terrifying! Especially when it comes to women.

150
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,519
But old age is also very powerful.

151
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:37,299
Especially when you have a hazel wand or a snake hairdo to swing around.

152
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,938
Next time we start our two episode wrap up of...

153
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,940
the whole series! I know I'm gonna miss you too, Thoth.

154
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:44,340
I'm also gonna miss you guys.

155
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:48,820
We're gonna talk about Freud and Jung and the psychological aspects of mythology.

156
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,539
Thanks for watching.

157
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,700
We'll see you soon.

158
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,000
Unless, Baba Yaga sees you first.

159
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,149
Check out our crash course mythology Thoth tote bag and poster available now at dftba.com.

160
