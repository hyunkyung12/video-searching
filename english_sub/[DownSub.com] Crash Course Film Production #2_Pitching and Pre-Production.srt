1
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:04,880
So you want to make a movie!

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,859
Let’s say you’ve already written a screenplay
you want to shoot, or found a story you’d

3
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:08,870
like to adapt.

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,179
Or maybe you just have an idea that you think
would make a good film.

5
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:12,179
What’s next?

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,309
There are a few steps you should take to sharpen
your idea and get all the pieces into place

7
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:17,860
to make production go as smoothly as possible.

8
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,460
Most filmmakers go through this process one
way or another, whether you’re making a

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,500
big-time studio blockbuster or a no-budget
indie with your friends.

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,600
It all begins with an awesome pitch.

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:38,600
[Opening Music Plays]

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,640
A pitch is a brief, verbal description of

13
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:41,950
a project you’d like to make.

14
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,760
It’s supposed to be persuasive: You’re
trying to get people excited about your idea,

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,010
usually because you need their help.

16
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,210
We pitch things all the time.

17
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,770
Kids try to persuade their parents to buy
them a dog or a car.

18
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,750
Employees make a case to get a promotion or
a raise.

19
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,380
And people try to convince their friends to
see the new Superman movie.

20
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,900
But in addition to getting people on board
with your project, a pitch can be a great

21
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,800
way to help you figure out if your story works
in the first place.

22
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,319
Is the concept compelling?

23
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,350
Is the climax satisfying?

24
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,100
Do the characters feel real and three-dimensional?

25
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,750
By gauging someone’s response, you might
decide to alter the plot, or re-think the

26
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,010
entire film.

27
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,220
And you can pitch an idea to just about anyone!

28
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,000
The late screenwriter, author, and educator
Blake Snyder suggested telling your film idea

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,440
to as many strangers as possible – bank
tellers, Uber drivers, the person waiting

30
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,240
in line behind you at the grocery store.

31
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,460
He believed that you’d get a more honest
reaction by pitching your story to someone

32
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,460
you don’t know.

33
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,000
Your mom might love whatever you tell her.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,680
The woman sitting next to you on the plane?

35
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,680
Not so much.

36
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,120
On the other hand, sometimes you might need a little encouragement.

37
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,721
And even if your parents and friends don’t
give you honest critical feedback, the act

38
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:42,750
of telling your story out loud can help you
understand it better.

39
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,080
A lot of filmmakers even pitch their movie
ideas to themselves: in the shower, in the

40
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,480
car, or pacing around a room while talking
to their cat.

41
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,010
Bottom line is, stories get better the more
you tell them.

42
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,780
You can identify the pieces that work and
figure out weaknesses before you start producing anything.

43
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,740
On the practical side, a pitch can get you
thinking about the resources you’ll need

44
00:01:57,741 --> 00:02:00,680
to bring your story to the screen, and help
get your film made.

45
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,890
Screenwriters might pitch an idea to a producer
or a studio executive, in hopes that person

46
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,619
will pay them to write the script.

47
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:10,060
Directors might pitch a project to a studio
or an investor to raise money to shoot it.

48
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,590
And filmmakers often pitch their movies to
well-known actors, hoping to persuade them

49
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,590
to star in the film.

50
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,950
Developing a pitch can also help you ballpark
your film’s budget.

51
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:21,480
Not just in terms of money, but also how much
time it will take, how big a crew you’ll

52
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,230
need, and what sort of special effects or
extra equipment you’ll require.

53
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,480
So how do you craft a movie pitch?Well, there’s
not a single formula, but there are a few

54
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,459
ingredients that most good pitches have.

55
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:32,430
First of all, you should deliver your pitch
with excitement and confidence.

56
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,409
You want your passion for your movie to be
infectious, and you want whoever’s listening

57
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:37,939
to believe you can pull it off.

58
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:41,909
Second, you might compare your film to other
successful movies that explore similar worlds

59
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:43,129
or have similar tones.

60
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:45,370
We call these comparisons, or comps for short.

61
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,790
Like, you might pitch The Martian as Cast
Away on Mars.

62
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,419
Or maybe The Edge of Tomorrow as Groundhog
Day by way of Independence Day.

63
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:55,620
Comps aren’t meant to limit your story or
make it seem like a copy of something else.

64
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,419
The goal is to convey the scope, genre, and
tone of your film.

65
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:00,680
Another thing most pitches include is a logline.

66
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,769
This is a one-sentence summary of your movie
that includes the genre, a description of

67
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:06,349
the protagonist, and a concise outline of
the plot.

68
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:09,150
The logline for Jaws, for instance, might
go something like this:

69
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,549
when a killer shark starts eating members
of a tourist beach town, the new chief of

70
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:15,519
police must overcome his fear of the water
to save his community.

71
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,879
Next, your pitch should include some information
about the characters and story.

72
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,590
This isn’t a painstaking scene-by-scene
description – just the main plot points,

73
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:27,409
key character moments, and enough of the emotional
arc to communicate why the story matters.

74
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:32,510
Some pitches can include visual aids: posters,
photographs, or even pre-designed trailers.

75
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:36,129
These work best when the film is set in another
time or place, like fantasy or science-fiction

76
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:37,939
movies that need a lot of world-building.

77
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:40,959
Your pitch could also suggest some casting
ideas.

78
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,970
Would Reese Witherspoon be great for your
satirical comedy?

79
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:49,239
Is your gritty noir perfect for a brooding
Idris Elba type?

80
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:52,519
Even if you don’t expect to have A-list
actors in your film, it can give your listener

81
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:55,209
a clearer idea of what the movie will look
and feel like.

82
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:56,639
Plus, you never know.

83
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:58,370
Lucy Liu might be their second cousin!

84
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:02,139
Finally, the pitch should tell us who you
think will watch the film.

85
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:03,430
How big is the potential audience?

86
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,739
What kind of resources will you need to market
and distribute it?

87
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:09,129
Is it a short film that you hope to screen
at film festivals, or a blockbuster that will

88
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:11,329
open in two thousand theaters?

89
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:14,290
Preparing a pitch that covers all these points
can improve your chances of getting your movie

90
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,358
made, while also making the story clearer
and stronger.

91
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,638
Now, let’s say you’ve honed your pitch,
written your script, and collected all the

92
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,580
resources you need to make the film.

93
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,650
Next, you have to get ready to shoot it.

94
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,520
We call this part of the process pre-production.

95
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,919
It’s the unglamorous work of making all
the creative decisions and logistical plans

96
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:33,550
you can before the cameras start to roll.

97
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,050
Depending on the size and scale of your film,
there are hundreds or even thousands of choices

98
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,050
to make.

99
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,949
During pre-production, you’ll cast your
film.

100
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:44,530
Whether you’re convincing family and friends
to act for you, or working with a casting

101
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:48,290
director and watching audition tapes, you’ll
need a person to play every character.

102
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:52,389
That includes lead actors, supporting actors,
and background actors to be extras – pedestrians

103
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:55,259
on the street, diners at a restaurant, or
fans at a baseball game.

104
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:57,160
You’ll also need to assemble your crew.

105
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,440
These are the artists, technicians, and craftspeople
who will physically make the movie, from

106
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,259
a cinematographer to oversee the camera department,
to an assistant director to make sure you’re

107
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:06,919
staying on schedule and on budget.

108
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:09,970
There are a ton of people that can be a
part of the crew, and we’ll talk about all

109
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,210
these roles in more detail in later episodes.

110
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,480
And besides assembling a dream team of people,
you’ll also need to establish the look of the film.

111
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,840
You have to figure out things like the color
scheme, the lighting plan, and when it takes place.

112
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,860
To tell your story, will you need unique props
or costumes?

113
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,660
Are there special effects involved, and how
do you need to plan for those during the actual shoot?

114
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,699
You’ll also need to find and secure all
of your locations during pre-production – whether

115
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:35,750
you need to build futuristic spaceship sets,
or if you can just shoot in your mom’s basement.

116
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,889
And that’s only a fraction of the questions
you should be considering:

117
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:41,830
Does your lead actor need a dialect coach
to learn a Dutch accent?

118
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:45,159
Do you need a stunt coordinator to plan your
big action sequence?

119
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:49,319
How many sandwiches will you need to order on day three to feed your cast and crew?

120
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:52,669
Pre-production can be an exhausting process,
but also an exhilarating one.

121
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:55,780
Even though you haven’t shot a single frame
yet, you’re already making your movie!

122
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:00,300
And one of your biggest assets while making
all these decisions is that screenplay you’ve

123
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,300
polished to perfection.

124
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,490
Either you or your line producer will do a
breakdown of the script.

125
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:08,780
This is essentially a big list of every character,
location, prop, costume, vehicle, and any

126
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,830
special needs of your film.

127
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:13,580
If you’re doing this on your own, a handy
trick is to take a highlighter and mark every

128
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,540
single noun in your script.

129
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,569
That way, you can make sure you’ve accounted
for all the things you need to gather to

130
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:21,000
make your film, no matter how incidental they
may be.

131
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,259
Once you have a breakdown, you can figure
out the film’s shooting schedule, which

132
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,949
details what scenes you’re going to film
and when.

133
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:30,509
Like, let’s say you’re making a movie
based on the board game Clue.Armed with the

134
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:35,060
breakdown and shooting schedule, you’ll
know things like: on day five, you’re going

135
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,719
to be shooting Scene 14.

136
00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:40,700
You should plan out when and where the cast
and crew are expected to arrive on set, down

137
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,439
to details like meal breaks and transportations
times.

138
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,860
You’ll need most of your leading actors:
Colonel Mustard, Mrs. Peacock, Mrs. White,

139
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,860
and Mr. Boddy.

140
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,560
You’ll need your actors to be fully costumed,
and you’ll also need some props: a candlestick,

141
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,930
a lead pipe, and a knife.

142
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,920
You’ll need some fake blood too, because
this is the scene where Mr. Boddy’s been stabbed.

143
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,860
And it all takes place in the “Study”
location, so that needs to be ready to go too.

144
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,520
Now, all this information will be compiled
into a call sheet.

145
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:09,009
This is a document given to every member of
the cast and crew before the next shooting

146
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:11,469
day, so they have everything they need to
get prepared to work.

147
00:07:11,469 --> 00:07:16,090
Call sheets also include a weather forecast
for each location, times for sunrise and sunset,

148
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:20,310
the addresses of nearby emergency services,
and maps from the set to things like the hair

149
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,320
and makeup trailer or the restrooms.

150
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,909
Finally, call sheets have contact information
for nearly everybody in the crew.

151
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:29,870
This comprehensive document is a culmination
of all the work of pre-production.

152
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,039
Armed with it, you’re finally ready to get
down to business and make your movie!

153
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,620
Today we talked about what goes into a movie
pitch and who you might share it with.

154
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,939
We learned the basic steps of pre-production,
from assembling your crew to building your

155
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:40,939
schedule, to best set you up to start making
your film.

156
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:45,440
And next time, we’ll visit the set and explore
what the crew actually does once the cameras

157
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,440
start rolling.

158
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,199
Crash Course Film Production is produced in
association with PBS Digital Studios.
