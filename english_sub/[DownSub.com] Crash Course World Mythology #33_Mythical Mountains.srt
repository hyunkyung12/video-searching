00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,110
Hi, I’m Mike Rugnetta, this is Crashcourse
Mythology and today we’re following up our

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,230
spelunking episode with some rock-climbing.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,230
[[[Thoth in climbing gear?]]]

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,650
That’s right, today we’re taking on mountains
of myth.

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,330
Big mountains, small mountains, holy mountains,
volcanic mountains.

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,330
Thoth!

7
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:18,280
You got your crampons … on?

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,240
Excelsior!

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:29,609
[Intro]
In myth, mountains are mysterious, dangerous,

10
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:31,769
and often have cool stuff inside them.

11
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:35,579
Because they reach towards the sky, they often
host the homes of gods.

12
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,640
Mount Olympus is probably the best known mountain
that’s both home to a pantheon and also

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,790
a real place where you can go eat grape leaves
and drink ouzo.

14
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:49,200
And – even without all that Greek grog –Mountains
are perilous, as anyone who has ever spent

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,809
time climbing them knows, and this makes them
a good spot for hero myths.

16
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:58,290
Mountains are often the homes of monsters,
the sites of avalanches, basically a big ole

17
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,399
heap of challenge.

18
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,680
If you’re wondering now why anyone would
ever go there, well, you can’t forget that

19
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,750
mountains also contain valuable minerals.

20
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,819
And in myths, that means that they’re the
site of great treasure, especially gold.

21
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:15,079
Today we’re gonna look at two myths: one
from China and one from Japan.

22
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:20,549
In the first story, we’ll encounter a mountain
full of treasures, though most of those treasures

23
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:23,420
are a lot more utilitarian than gold.

24
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:29,229
We’re also gonna look at a mountain that’s
a treasure itself, in that it has a god associated

25
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:30,229
with it.

26
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:31,719
A very competitive god.

27
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:36,229
A perfect example of a mountain stuffed with
treasure comes from China where people tell

28
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:39,520
the story of Ko-li and the Ten Thousand Treasure
Mountain.

29
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,719
It’s a story of magic artifacts and a treacherous
king.

30
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:49,279
But in the end, both K’o-li and his mother
demonstrate self-sacrifice and hard work.

31
00:01:49,279 --> 00:01:52,669
K’o-li and his mother live in a valley among
the high mountains.

32
00:01:52,669 --> 00:01:58,319
They’re too poor to have rice or corn, so
they survive by eating roots that K’o-li

33
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,319
digs up.

34
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:03,319
One day, he’s only able to dig up enough
food for one person.

35
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:06,130
He gives the roots to his mother, saying he
isn’t hungry.

36
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:10,939
But his mother refuses, saying she can’t
take the food while K’o-li wastes away.

37
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:15,739
Just then, an old man with a long white beard
appears at the door.

38
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:20,739
They give their food to this “Old Father”
and after he eats, K’o-li picks him up and

39
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:22,620
carries him back to his home in the mountains.

40
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,300
When they arrive at the Old Man’s home,
they’re greeted by his beautiful daughter.

41
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:31,380
In gratitude, the old man asks her to give
K’o-li her earrings as a reward for his

42
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,489
virtue.

43
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:38,760
As it turns out, these earrings are also keys
to the Ten Thousand Treasure Mountain.

44
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,989
One is made of gold and it opens the secret
door.

45
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:44,989
The other is silver and it allows you to leave.

46
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:48,090
K’o-li takes the earrings and unlocks to
the door to the treasure trove.

47
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:54,440
Inside, the mountain is filled with incredible
treasures: gold, silver, pearls.

48
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,780
But K’o-li is both humble and practical.

49
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,629
He chooses a simple white stone grinder so
that he’ll be able to earn a living grinding

50
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:03,629
grain.

51
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:07,829
He lets himself out with the silver earring,
and brings the grinder home to his mother.

52
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:12,450
As soon as K’o-li tries to use the grinder,
he discovers that instead of grinding grains,

53
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,920
it actually produces corn.

54
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,560
K’o-li and his mother can’t believe their
luck, and they take the magical corn to share

55
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,019
with the rest of their village.

56
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:27,330
Eventually, news of this magical corn-producing-grinder
reaches the king.

57
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:32,319
He orders that an official should to travel
to the village and bring him this magic grinder.

58
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:38,019
The official arrives, and demands the grinder,
but the second he touches it, it crumbles

59
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:39,870
into a pile of lime.

60
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:44,760
The king is furious and has the official beheaded.

61
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,830
Without the magic grinder, it isn’t long
before K’o-li and his mother are hungry

62
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:49,889
again.

63
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:54,109
K’o-li goes back to the Ten Thousand Treasure
Mountain, and uses the golden earring.

64
00:03:54,109 --> 00:04:00,310
This time, he chooses a yellow stone mortar
that magically produces white rice.

65
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,680
He silver-earrings his way out, takes the
mortar home and before long… the king is

66
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,219
hearing stories about magical rice now!

67
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:09,250
He orders another official to get the mortar.

68
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,779
The official arrives at the village, grabs
it, and wouldn’t you know – it turns to

69
00:04:12,779 --> 00:04:13,799
lime.

70
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:15,299
Another official loses his head.

71
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:17,880
Hungry again, K’o-li returns to the mountain.

72
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,048
This time he chooses a hoe.

73
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:25,000
At home, he pulls the hoe across the ground
and giant corn stalks grow.

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,169
K’o-li shares his food with the villagers
and again, the king hears the news.

75
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:34,050
This time, rather than seize the hoe, officials
seize K’o-li and bring him to the king.

76
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,050
Everyone gets to keep their head this time.

77
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:39,460
The king demands to know: where are you getting
these wonderful treasures?

78
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:43,870
K’o-li tells the greedy king about the Ten
Thousand Treasure mountain: “I open the

79
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,370
door in the mountain with this gold earring
and…”

80
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:52,000
But then and there – the king snatches the
gold earring and sets off immediately.

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,870
The king rides as fast as he can to the mountain
and gets inside.

82
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:01,150
As the gold key grants his access, his eyes
fill with visions of treasure.

83
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:06,800
But behind him, the door to the mountain closes
-- with K’o-li and the freedom-granting

84
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,130
silver earring … outside.

85
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:13,110
Now you might think K’o-li would be worried
about the king trapped in the mountain, where

86
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,510
he’ll probably starve to death or asphyxiate
or get crushed by all that treasure.

87
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:20,850
But K’o-li has more pressing concerns: He’s
lost one of the girl’s earrings!

88
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:28,009
His mother bundles up two bushels of corn
and takes it the old man’s home to apologize.

89
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:32,310
But when she arrives, Old Father tells her
“we don’t need your corn!

90
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,199
Use it to feed your village.

91
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:39,870
I’ve decided, your son is so honest and
hard-working, he and my daughter should be

92
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:40,870
married.”

93
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:45,770
Which is to say - the generous, hard-working
K’o-li lived happily ever after, while the

94
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:51,050
greedy king perished underground, surrounded
by useless riches.

95
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,910
But… were they EVEN RICHES?

96
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,310
THINKY FACE…

97
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,129
EMOJI
The Ten Thousand Treasure Mountain represents

98
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:03,820
an important opportunity, and location, for
our main character.

99
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:07,169
But some mountains are the main characters
themselves.

100
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:13,340
Even today, Japan has a complex religious
landscape: a mix of the ancient religion Shintoism,

101
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:18,780
the 6th-century addition of Buddhism and more
recently a dash of Christianity.

102
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:23,469
According to Leonard & McClure, “Shinto
views all landforms – indeed all things

103
00:06:23,469 --> 00:06:27,069
– as being closely associated with a particular
kami.”

104
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:32,419
A kami is a kind of god, and mountains, trees,
stones, lakes, even grains ... have their

105
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:33,770
own kami.

106
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:38,449
When Buddhism arrived in Japan in the 6th
century BCE, it needed to assimilate to the

107
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:44,250
pre-existing animistic religion and the result
was a syncretic combination of Buddhist figures

108
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,650
and styles of worship with Shinto shrines
and gods.

109
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:52,939
One way to see this relationship is to look
at one myth involving two famous mountains

110
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:54,319
and the Buddha Amida.

111
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,439
The story starts long ago, with an argument
between Mt. Yatsu-ga-take and Mt. Fuji.

112
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:02,360
Both mountains are animated by their own kami.

113
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,949
One day, Yatsu-ga-take and Fuji begin to argue
about which one of them is taller.

114
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:13,419
No matter how they debate, they can’t reach
an answer, so they ask Buddha Amida to be

115
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:14,419
the judge.

116
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:18,360
Amida runs a pipe between the tops of the
two mountains and pours water in it to see

117
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,330
which way it will flow.

118
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:25,539
The water flows downward toward Fuji – Yatsu-ga-take
is taller!

119
00:07:25,539 --> 00:07:30,259
When Amida announces the results, Fuji is
furious.

120
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:35,169
She attacks Yatsu-ga-take with a stick, smashing
great gaps into his top.

121
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:38,790
That’s why Yatsu-ga-take has eight peaks.

122
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:43,400
Many mountains are revered in Japanese culture,
but none more so than Mt. Fuji.

123
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,860
(It’s always a good idea to revere a mountain
that might rough you up.)

124
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:52,450
But Mt. Fuji and Asama no Okami, the kami
associated with her, aren’t always depicted

125
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,450
so aggressively.

126
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:57,789
For instance, there was once a boy named Yosoji
who lives near Mt. Fuji.

127
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:04,460
Yosoji’s mother has smallpox and is dying,
so he asks the magician Kamo Yamakiko for

128
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,460
help.

129
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:10,710
Kamo Yamakiko tells Yosoji: if he wants to
save his mother, he must fetch water from

130
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:14,919
the source of a small stream near the southwest
side of Mt. Fuji.

131
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:19,980
Yosoji sets out but is confounded when the
path branches into three paths.

132
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:25,020
Suddenly a beautiful girl dressed in white
steps out of the forest and leads him down

133
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,409
the correct path to the stream.

134
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:32,510
And in that stream, some Thoughtbubbles:
When Yosoji arrives at the stream, the girl

135
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,710
tells him to drink, and then gather water
for his mother.

136
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:41,470
Then she leads Yosoji back to the crossroads
and tells him to meet her there again in three

137
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:45,230
days, because he’s going to need more of
the magical water.

138
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,760
Yosoji does as he’s told.

139
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,070
He takes the water back to his home, and gives
it to his mother to drink, along with many

140
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,580
other sick villagers.

141
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,600
When he runs out of water, he returns to meet
the mysterious girl.

142
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,980
He does this again and again.

143
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:04,410
After five trips, his mother and the rest
of the sick villagers are cured.

144
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:10,540
The villagers praise him, but Yosoji knows
that he owes it all to the beautiful girl,

145
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,600
so he goes to thank her.

146
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,400
When Yosoji arrives, the stream has dried
up.

147
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:21,620
He’s surprised and sad; he prays for the
girl to appear so he can thank her properly.

148
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:25,530
When he rises from prayer, poof, there she
is.

149
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:30,460
Yosoji thanks her and begs the girl to reveal
her name, because y’know... “beautiful

150
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:34,100
girl from the magical stream” is a pretty
weird thing to call someone.

151
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,370
But she won’t tell him.

152
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:42,570
Instead, she swings a branch of camellia in
the air and a cloud flies down from Mt. Fuji,

153
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:46,710
enveloping her and carrying her back to the
sacred mountain.

154
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:53,290
That … is when Yosoji realizes the girl
is actually the goddess of Mt. Fuji, moonlighting

155
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,250
as a stream kami.

156
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,820
Right then and there, his heart fills with
love for her.

157
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:03,250
He kneels down before the retreating goddess
and she tosses the camellia branch to him...

158
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,220
a symbol of their connection.

159
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,840
Thanks, Thoughtbubble, that was some “peak”
mythology!

160
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,040
And very touching, showing us the more generous
side of mountains.

161
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:19,590
See, it’s not all rocks and suffocation;
mountains are also a place of pure, life-giving

162
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,590
water.

163
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:23,320
They’re as varied as any pantheon we’ve
encountered!

164
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,800
Though… seemingly less incestous.

165
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,400
Probably a good thing.

166
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,330
Today we’ve seen rich mountains, competitive
mountains, angry mountains, and finally a

167
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,310
loving and generous mountain.

168
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:36,990
We’ve also realized that while gods are
often represented as people and animals (and

169
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:41,260
people-animal hybrids)... elements of the
natural world, like mountains in all their

170
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:44,490
mile-high power and grandeur, can represent
gods, too.

171
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,370
Gods you can climb.

172
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,940
Is there nothing we humans won’t anthropomorphize?

173
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,940
Thanks for watching.

174
00:10:49,940 --> 00:00:00,000
And see you next time, when we’re gonna
make like some trees… and myth.
