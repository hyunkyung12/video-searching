1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,310
Hey there, I’m Mike Rugnetta and this is
Crashcourse mythology.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:08,080
Today, we’re going to tackle one of the
most difficult and fascinating pantheons in

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,080
all of mythology.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,089
It’s got dancing dwarves, buffalo demons,
and some many armed folks.

5
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:18,090
Yessir there’s a lot going on in this pantheon!

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,640
Maybe even more than in the Egyptian pantheon.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,900
Sorry Thoth.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,230
In this episode, we’ll talk about the pantheon
of deities in Indian myths.

9
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,419
Unlike myths from Egypt and the Ancient Near
East, there are living people for whom these

10
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:33,469
stories have deep, personal, religious meaning.

11
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:37,730
Remember how it got a little uncomfortable
when we discussed the Bible’s creation story?

12
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,870
Well, it’s gonna be a bit like that.

13
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,860
But we’re gonna try to minimize the awkwardness.

14
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,700
Just ask--wait, there’s no god of awkwardness?!

15
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,800
Ruh roh.

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:56,700
INTRO

17
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,360
Discussing the Indian pantheon is tricky for
two reasons: first because it remains a living

18
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,740
belief system for about a billion people.

19
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:11,060
And second because Indian religious and mythic
traditions are not only abundant but also

20
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,130
ancient.

21
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:16,770
As in Egypt, there are different sets of gods
and goddesses that were worshipped at different

22
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,090
points in time.

23
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:24,619
But unlike Egypt, India was and is home to
many different languages, which means we have

24
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:28,360
a lot of different stories, each with many
different versions.

25
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,600
We are going to focus mostly on stories that
have been written in Sanskrit, the sacred

26
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,420
language of Hinduism.

27
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:40,479
Sanskrit first appears in written form around
150 CE in a series of rock inscriptions that

28
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,590
look much more complex than what I’ve inscribed
on rocks.

29
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,469
This probably doesn’t say “Parvati wuz
here!

30
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:49,510
Vishnu + Lakshmi 5eva.”

31
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:55,270
Let’s remember that Sanskrit is a complex
language and its poetry may sound unusual

32
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,450
to English ears.

33
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,590
But we can handle it.

34
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,860
Lead the way, Bragi, Norse God of poetry.

35
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:07,079
In the earliest Indian traditions, Dyaus the
sky father, and Prithvi the earth mother were

36
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,079
central.

37
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:09,340
Hey, sky dad and earth mom!

38
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,440
Nice to see you over here, too!

39
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,770
Do you mind if I drop off some cosmic laundry?

40
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:18,940
Later, however, Surya the sun god, Agni the
fire god and Indra the warrior king of the

41
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:25,210
gods took top God Billing from mom and dad,
who were arguing all the time!

42
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,070
Sky dad, earth mom, knock it off!

43
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,440
Just stop the fighting!

44
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,440
We can all get along.

45
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,220
Indra was the child of the sky and the earth,
and was responsible for keeping them separate,

46
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:40,920
but had his own beef with another god, Varuna,
who may once have been the ruler of the gods,

47
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,470
but was supplanted by Indra.

48
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,470
Hey, even god’s got beef, right?

49
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,750
Wonder if one of them recorded a diss track...

50
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:53,160
Anyway, the most well-known myth about Indra
is about his battle with Vritra, a giant serpent

51
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:59,440
or dragon, whom Indra kills, thus creating
the sun, the dawn, and they sky.

52
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,290
(Yeah, I know – you thought we had sky covered
but, mythology is tricky.)

53
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,430
The death of Vritra also gave form to chaos.

54
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,430
Which is nice.

55
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:11,810
So yup, it’s our old friend the creation
story, but with violence instead of sex.

56
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:17,600
In a number of stories, Indra is described
as battling and destroying hostile minor deities

57
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
and demons.

58
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,990
I mean, someone has to, right?

59
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,010
And so maybe, you’re thinking yay, Indra.

60
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,530
He fights the good fight.

61
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:29,770
But… he also breaks oaths,kills family members
and commits adultery with Ahalya, the wife

62
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,170
of the sage Gvautama.

63
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,860
For which he lost his testicles.

64
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,860
Cherries emoji.

65
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,860
Scissors emoji.

66
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,200
Face Screaming in emoji.

67
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:41,040
But hey wait, it’s OK. in another myth he
has them replaced with those of a ram.

68
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,040
Emoji.

69
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,040
So...um...guess that worked out.

70
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,740
Indra’s weapon of choice is a thunderbolt,
similar to Zeus, and by India’s classical

71
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,530
age he becomes a god of rain.

72
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,560
And this changing function over time is generally
emblematic of Indian myth.

73
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,660
Like the Egyptian pantheon, it’s difficult
to pin down one canonical set of myths or

74
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,530
characters because they appear in so many
forms, often with multiple names.

75
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:08,350
Here’s another version of how things get
going: In the Vedas, which are the most ancient

76
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:12,470
Hindu scriptures, Prajapati was the creator
god, but over time, and especially in the

77
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:18,470
Upanishads, another collection of important
Sanskrit texts, the less anthropomorphic concept

78
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,390
of Brahman developed.

79
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:27,860
Brahman isn’t a GOD so much as the all-encompassing
essence of reality, the supreme cosmic spirit.

80
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,500
Pretty cool, right Thoth?

81
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,750
It’s not something you can easily represent
on a sandstone relief, but then again it’s

82
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,360
not that dissimilar from “god” in monotheistic
religious traditions.

83
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,780
Brahman has sometimes been translated as the
“world soul” and all individual souls

84
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,280
are one with it.

85
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,690
Don’t get too comfortable, though, because
Brahman, in later classical Hindu mythology

86
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:56,130
and religion, is embodied and personified
as three deities: Brahma, the creator, Vishnu,

87
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,190
the preserver, and Shiva, the destroyer.

88
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:03,020
They are all distinct, with their own stories,
and yet also represent aspects of the more

89
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,600
esoteric and universal idea of Brahman.

90
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,660
This triumvirate?

91
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,690
Trifecta?

92
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:10,950
Divine Hat Trick?

93
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:16,160
Hindus call it the trimurti and Vishnu and
Shiva loom largest in Indian myths.

94
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,660
So then, why is Brahma third banana?

95
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,530
Well, once the universe is created, the work
of the creator is done.

96
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,780
True, The concept of cyclical existence is
central to the Hindu and Buddhist worldview,

97
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:31,160
so you’d think a creator would be considered
among the most important gods.

98
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:36,030
Still, Brahma’s significance declined in
comparison with that of Vishnu and Shiva,

99
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:41,890
perhaps because, according to John Brockington:
Essentially he is a fusion of a creator deity

100
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:47,220
with the impersonal Brahman propounded in
the Upanishads, which see the goal of religious

101
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:53,410
endeavor as some kind of union with the absolute,
whereas the popular forms of religion attested

102
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:57,680
to in the epics prefer a more personal and
devotional approach.

103
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,410
In other words, Brahma doesn’t really get
involved in the juicy stuff-- battles and

104
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,750
quests and adultery.

105
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,920
So let’s turn to Vishnu, the preserver.

106
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:12,230
Stories of Vishnu often involve his consort
Shri, also called Lakshmi, a goddess of prosperity

107
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,690
and good fortune, which is pretty terrific
as dowries go.

108
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:22,150
Vishnu protects the world from evil, and he
often appears in different forms called “avatars”.

109
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:27,260
Avatars are the human or animal form of a
god on earth and they are very, very rad.

110
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:31,040
By the classical period, Vishnu had 10 or
so avatars:

111
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,850
Matsya, the fish, who we’ll hear more about
when we talk about floods

112
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:37,880
Kurma the tortoise, who played a role similar
to the tortoise in the earth diver myth that

113
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,550
we saw
Varaha, the boar who is a boar and does boar

114
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,690
stuff
Narasimha the man-lion who kills the demon

115
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:48,389
Hiranyakashipu
Vamana, the dwarf who defeats the demon Bai

116
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:52,220
through trickery
Parashurama who kills the hundred-armed Arjuna

117
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,419
with an ax and probably has amazing biceps
Rama and

118
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:59,210
Krishna who are central to the Mahabaratha,
one of the great Sanskrit epics

119
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,350
The Buddha who is the Buddha.

120
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,350
You know.

121
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,460
From Buddhism.

122
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:08,950
Kalkin who is a future avatar and a millennial
figure that will establish a new era.

123
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,690
But not like, a millennial millennial.

124
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,920
Kalkin is not on Snapchat.

125
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:19,750
Shiva, the destroyer, had his origins in the
Vedic era as a storm god who was a “wrathful

126
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:24,260
avenger” and a “herdsman of souls,”
which definitely sounds trickier than sheep.

127
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:29,090
Shiva is also associated with yoga, asceticism
and erotic love.

128
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,770
Which definitely sounds contradictory.

129
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:32,770
Or maybe just flexible.

130
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:38,321
This erotic aspect manifests most concretely
in Shiva’s symbolic form as a linga, which

131
00:07:38,321 --> 00:07:43,460
is self-explanatory if you look at it, and
might explain why Shiva has numerous female

132
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:49,530
deities as either wives or consorts, including
Sati and Parvati, and sometimes Durga and

133
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:50,530
Kali.

134
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,449
Basically, Shiva has game.

135
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:59,310
One of the best known images of Shiva is his
depiction asl the lord of the dance–no,

136
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,850
definitely not, yes.

137
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:05,889
According to one scholar:
“His steps are intended to relieve by enlightenment

138
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:12,470
the suffrage of his devotees: hence he balances
on the back of a dwarf who symbolizes ignorance.

139
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:17,130
His gestures and the attributes he is holding
symbolize aspects of his divinity; the drum

140
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:22,360
in his back right hand [symbolizes creation],
the tongue of flame in his back left hand

141
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:29,810
[symbolizes destruction], the gesture of protection
[of his front right hand symbolizes] protection

142
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,240
and his raised leg symboliz[es] release.”

143
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,969
Has Michael Flatley ever balanced on the back
of a dwarf?

144
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:37,400
I rest my case.

145
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,860
Now we’ve spent most of the episode discussing
the three key gods of the trimurti and their

146
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:47,589
amazing dance moves, but Indian pantheons
feature goddesses, too, who usually have qualities

147
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:49,600
that complement their husband’s powers.

148
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,640
I mentioned Parvati and Uma and Sati, the
wives of Shiva, and Laskshmi, who is married

149
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,640
to Vishnu.

150
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,671
But other traditions describe the goddess
Devi, which translates to “goddess” or

151
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:05,920
Mahadevi, the great goddess, who is occasionally
associated with these other consorts and sometimes

152
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,310
seen as a world creator in her own right.

153
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:13,040
In some traditions Devi is essentially the
same as Brahman.

154
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,930
Like many of the deities we discuss, Devi
can be many things to many people.

155
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,470
We haven’t seen too many female warrior
goddesses yet.

156
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:26,330
So let’s wrap up with a story that features
one: Durga, also known as Kali, who is unapproachable

157
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,760
to her suitors and invincible in battle.

158
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,779
Also she rides a lion.

159
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,570
So clearly - no one is cool enough to date
her.

160
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:33,760
Thoughtbubble, do your thing.

161
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:39,160
One of the main stories about Durga is that
of her killing the buffalo demon Mahisha.

162
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:44,350
Mahisha conquered the other lesser gods, the
Devas, and then the Devas went to Vishnu and

163
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,510
Shiva for help, who listened and grew angry.

164
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:50,440
And you wouldn’t like Vishnu and Shiva when
they’re angry, because their anger takes

165
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,760
the form of Durga, who confronted Mahisha
and the other demons.

166
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:02,070
“The demons rushed towards the goddess who
killed them in hundreds, felling some with

167
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:09,800
her club, catching others in her noose, slicing
others with her sword, and piercing others

168
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,940
with her trident.

169
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:16,980
Meanwhile, Mahisha himself, in buffalo form,
terrorized her troops.

170
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:22,370
Then he attacked her lion, and Durga became
furious.

171
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:27,960
She caught him in her noose, whereupon he
quitted his buffalo shape and became a lion

172
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,960
himself.

173
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,110
She cut off its head and he emerged as a man,
sword in hand.

174
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:39,890
As she pierced the man, he became a great
elephant, seizing her lion with its trunk,

175
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:44,649
but she cut off his trunk with her sword as
he resumed his buffalo form.

176
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:50,140
Lightly tossing aside the mountains he hurled
at her, she leaped on him, pinned his neck

177
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,899
with one foot and pierced him with her trident.

178
00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:56,150
Then she cut off his head with her mighty
sword.”

179
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,150
Thanks, Thoughtbubble, that was... harrowing?

180
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:01,380
I guess it’s always the second beheading
that sticks.

181
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,310
CONCLUSION
This episode could only scratch the surface

182
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,910
of the complexity of Indian mythology.

183
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:12,000
Not only does it come from so many sources,
but for many people these are living myths,

184
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,850
unlike the deeds of Egyptian gods that we
saw last week.

185
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:21,890
These stories are complex because people associate
one god with one or two attributes or phenomena,

186
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,399
like wisdom or storms.

187
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:28,990
And these gods take many forms and are often
seen as versions of each other, or maybe of

188
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,960
a single universal god.

189
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:37,600
Hinduism is a fascinating religion and a rich
source of myths, but it’s also quite the

190
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
web.

191
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,000
Emoji.

192
00:11:40,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thanks for watching. We'll see you next week.
