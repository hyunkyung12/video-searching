1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:07,450
Films can do a great job of taking us inside
the minds of characters.

2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:12,110
Martin Scorsese burrows into the warped psyche
of Robert De Niro’s vigilante in Taxi Driver.

3
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:16,740
In Safe, director Todd Haynes asks us to see
the world through the eyes of Julianne Moore’s

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,360
suburban housewife, who may or may not be
going crazy.

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,450
And, of course, David Fincher’s Fight Club
fractures a character’s mind so deeply that

6
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:26,040
by the end we have to re-evaluate everything
we’ve seen.

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,840
In 1993, the acclaimed Polish director Krzysztof Kieślowski

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,900
released a film that explores
the mental and emotional experience of a woman

9
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,900
grieving her husband and young daughter.

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,269
It’s heavy material, but the filmmaking
remains lyrical, expressive, and humane.

11
00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:43,320
So let’s take a closer look at Krzysztof
Kieślowski’s Blue.

12
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:56,060
[Intro Music Plays]

13
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,700
[intro]
Blue is actually the first film in a loose trilogy.

14
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,800
After making The Decalogue, a collection of
ten short films inspired by the Ten Commandments,

15
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:05,920
writer-director Krzysztof Kieslowski 
decided to make a series of feature films

16
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,130
named after the three colors of the French
flag.

17
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,210
He and co-writer Krzysztof Piesiewicz — and, yes, they’re both named Krzysztof

18
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,560
— mistakenly believed that each color represented
one of the three ideals of the French Revolution:

19
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,119
liberty, equality, and fraternity.

20
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,450
They liked that framework so much that they
stuck with it, even when they learned that

21
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,390
the colors and the motto weren’t directly
linked.

22
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,400
It didn’t matter much anyway, since Kieslowski
wasn’t interested in making explicitly political films.

23
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:32,700
He’s a deeply humanist filmmaker, and all
his films are notable for their patience,

24
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,710
their emotional power, and their closely-observed
characters.

25
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:39,700
The stories often examine how universal themes
play out in the intimate moments and day-to-day

26
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,899
lives of humans.

27
00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:43,420
And Blue is Kieslowski’s movie about liberty.

28
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,509
He chose to focus on a character who, in the
wake of a tragic accident, attempts to liberate

29
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:52,079
herself from all ties to her past, her own
desires, and even the world itself.

30
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,189
Juliette Binoche plays Julie, the
protagonist.

31
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:58,600
Her husband, Patrice, and young daughter,
Anna, are killed in a car accident within

32
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,999
the first few minutes of the film.

33
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:02,770
The story then follows her attempts to go
on without them.

34
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,740
And, at first, she almost chooses not to.

35
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,860
While recovering in the hospital from the
accident, Julie tries to kill herself.

36
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,640
She stops, but we immediately understand the
depth and power of her grief.

37
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,780
Back in the world, she resolves to strip all
traces of her family from her life.

38
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:22,530
She just wants to exist, free from all attachments
— physical, emotional, and spiritual.

39
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,910
She sells most of her possessions and puts
her country estate on the market.

40
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:30,220
The only thing she keeps is a mobile made
from blue crystals that hung in her daughter’s room.

41
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:34,391
She collects sheet music for an unfinished
composition her husband was working on, and

42
00:02:34,391 --> 00:02:36,470
throws it into the jaws of a garbage truck.

43
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:40,390
And she moves to a nondescript apartment building
with no children in it and finds a bit of

44
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,370
peace in her solitary nighttime swims in the
building’s pool.

45
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,780
Her isolation is almost complete.

46
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,810
And yet, the more she tries free herself from
the past, the more it seems to grip her.

47
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,790
A boy who witnessed the crash tracks her down
and attempts to return a necklace he took

48
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:54,790
from the accident.

49
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:58,730
Caught off-guard, Julie appreciates the gesture,
but tells him to keep it.

50
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,780
She doesn’t want another physical reminder
of her family.

51
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,160
She’s also haunted by her husband’s unfinished
symphony.

52
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,640
Pieces of it play over the soundtrack at emotional
moments.

53
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,760
And sometimes Julie seems to hear it, as
if it’s surging up from inside her own mind.

54
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,640
She also discovers Patrice has left behind
a very tangible echo of himself.

55
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,120
He had been having a long-term affair, and
his mistress is pregnant with his child.

56
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,970
As it becomes clear that Julie can’t actually
free herself from her memories, she begins

57
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,430
to wrestle with new ways to live in the world.

58
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:37,720
Reluctantly, she works to complete her husband’s
symphony with his steadfast colleague Olivier,

59
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,970
played by Benoît Régent.

60
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,250
She gives her country house to Patrice’s
mistress, suggesting that her unborn child

61
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,190
should have both Patrice’s name and his
house.

62
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:50,570
And by the end of the film, she even seems
open to a possible romantic relationship with

63
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,570
Olivier.

64
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:52,570
Maybe.

65
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,570
Just maybe.

66
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:57,320
As the complete version of Patrice’s composition
plays at the end of the film, we check in

67
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,440
with each of our major characters, ending
with a weeping Julie who gives a hint of a smile.

68
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,960
It’s one final indication that she might
be healing, even if the hurt will never fully

69
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,980
go away.

70
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,760
At the core of Blue is Binoche’s powerful performance
as her character navigates grief.

71
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,709
She’s in every scene and rarely speaks more
than a few lines at a time.

72
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:20,700
Kieślowski keeps the camera close to her
face, tracking the emotions roiling inside

73
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,690
her, from despair to tenderness.

74
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,030
And often she embodies more than one of those
conflicting emotions at once.

75
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:30,510
In the scene where she confronts Patrice’s
mistress, Binoche is somehow able to play

76
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:35,500
Julie’s hurt and anger, but also her curiosity,
determination, and maybe even envy.

77
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,830
She’s lost her child, and this stranger
is carrying her husband’s unborn son!

78
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,400
Kieślowski and cinematographer Slawomir Idziak also flood the film with the color blue.

79
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,880
Not a huge surprise there… it’s in the
title, after all.

80
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,970
And one way to critique a film is to analyze
motifs that the filmmakers use again and again

81
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,970
to try and understand some deeper meaning.

82
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,570
Whether it’s sunlight refracted through
the blue mobile crystals, or the wavering

83
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:03,090
hues of the swimming pool, the color seems
to take on different meanings to match Julie’s

84
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,090
emotions.

85
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,090
Writing in The New Review of Film, author
and Kieślowski scholar Steven Woodward observes

86
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:12,680
that despite the American association of blue
with sorrow, the color is actually the least

87
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,030
culturally defined of Kieślowski’s trilogy.

88
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:19,700
White commonly represents innocence, purity,
and light, while red often signifies desire,

89
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,790
heat, or anger.

90
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:26,200
But blue can be soothing or sad, distant or
refreshing, scary or relaxing.

91
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,770
And that makes it the perfect color to illustrate
Julie’s shifting emotions.

92
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,770
When she steps into Anna’s empty room, we
discover its walls are all blue.

93
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,520
Overcome, Julie attacks the mobile, tearing
off some of its crystals.

94
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,020
Here, blue is a prison, a stark reminder of
what she’s lost.

95
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,250
Elsewhere, the color seems to haunt Julie.

96
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,620
Off-screen lights will inexplicably turn blue,
making her look ghostly.

97
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,210
For some shots, Kieślowski and Idziak went
so far as to wrap the entire camera in blue

98
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:54,100
gels, which are those transparent filters
used in lighting.

99
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:59,030
Beyond color, Kieślowski uses sound and music
in sophisticated ways to give us a sense of

100
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,190
Julie’s experience.

101
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,530
Most of the music in the film is non-diegetic.

102
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:06,660
That’s music added to the film to create
meaning or heighten emotion, but it doesn’t

103
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,460
have a source within the world of the film.

104
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,950
In other words, it’s music that the characters
in the film can’t actually hear.

105
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,610
Even though we, the audience, do.

106
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,080
Kieślowski and composer Zbigniew Preisner play with the line between

107
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,360
diegetic and non-diegetic sound to great effect.

108
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,260
When Julie first retrieves the score for her
husband’s symphony, we hear pieces of the

109
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,260
music.

110
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,260
And so does Julie.

111
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,520
Or at least she imagines it, and we get
to listen into her imagination.

112
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:39,480
And when she throws the sheet music into the
garbage truck, the song distorts as the trash

113
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,360
compactor’s teeth tear the paper.

114
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,270
This extreme use of subjective sound puts
us in Julie’s experience even more fully.

115
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:57,620
And the opening chords of Patrice’s symphony
haunt Julie throughout the film.

116
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,020
In one early scene, Julie sits alone in a
chair at night, shortly after watching her

117
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,120
family’s funeral through a little TV set.

118
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,110
The opening beats of the symphony blare on
the soundtrack as a bright blue light fills

119
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,680
the room.

120
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,960
Julie looks almost directly at the camera
with a vaguely terrified expression, watching

121
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,770
us as we dolly away from her, and then back
toward her.

122
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:29,290
Suddenly, Julie seems aware not only of the
non-diegetic score, but also of the camera.

123
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:33,020
Are we inhabiting Patrice’s or Anna’s
ghost, back from the dead to spook her?

124
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,800
Or are we her grief, threatening to overwhelm
her?

125
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,240
Some critics have argued that this scene actually
depicts Julie’s call to action.

126
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,720
It’s the first indication that her salvation
will come through helping Olivier finish the symphony.

127
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,021
By the time she finally agrees to work on
the composition at the end of the film, we

128
00:07:47,021 --> 00:07:50,520
can even think of the symphony as a metaphor
for Julie herself.

129
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,490
Just like her, it’s a bit of a mess.

130
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:56,139
And only by bringing it to life is Julie able
to find some measure of peace.

131
00:07:56,139 --> 00:08:00,080
When she first starts working on the composition,
Kieślowski gives us a close-up of the notes

132
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,110
on the page.

133
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,120
As Julie’s finger moves along them, we hear
the music indicated by the notes.

134
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,160
Then she starts suggesting changes and we hear the
new musical arrangement.

135
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,680
It’s a remarkable moment that plays beautifully
with this gap between diegetic and non-diegetic

136
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,899
sound, as we hear the score that Julie imagines.

137
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:38,320
Not only that, we hear it getting better
at the same time that Julie herself is getting better.

138
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,680
Georgina Evans, a film scholar at the University
of Cambridge, has a unique reading of Blue

139
00:08:42,698 --> 00:08:47,220
that explores the film’s intense identification
with Julie’s subjective experience.

140
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,939
Evans suggests that maybe Julie experiences
synesthesia, a “neural condition in which

141
00:08:51,939 --> 00:08:55,730
a stimulus to one sense produces a response
in one or more others.”

142
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:59,490
In other words, maybe Julie sees music and
hears color.

143
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:03,160
So when the symphony plays over emotional
moments, or when a new shade of blue washes

144
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,110
over her face, perhaps that’s how Julie
processes the world around her.

145
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,350
This interpretation may also give new meaning
to one of the most interesting shots near

146
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,430
the end of the film.

147
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:15,529
When Julie finally gives in and helps Olivier
complete the symphony, the sequence ends with

148
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:20,560
a wide shot of them that goes out of focus,
and then stays that way for a long time.

149
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,100
We hear Julie and Olivier, but we only see
them as fuzzy shapes deep within the frame.

150
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,839
It’s as if Julie needs enter some sort of
blurry mental state and let her senses fully

151
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,949
merge in order to create.

152
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,440
Finally, it’s worth noting that this film
links Julie to the music in a very literal way.

153
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,960
Music doesn’t really exist with only one
note.

154
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,880
As a karaoke singing demon once said...

155
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,280
Lorne: It's like a song. Now, I can hold a note for a long time.

156
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,120
Lorne: Actually, I can hold a note forever.

157
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,800
Lorne: But, eventually, that's just noise. It's the change we're listening for.

158
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,640
Lorne: The note coming after and the one after that. That's what makes it music.

159
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,960
And the same is true here.

160
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:00,660
Julie suffers, as a single person — or note
— in isolation.

161
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,569
But as she collaborates on the symphony and
connects with more people, more notes and

162
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:06,670
more variations of those notes appear.

163
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,129
The score grows right along with Julie.

164
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:13,540
So Blue could be about isolation as a coping
mechanism for grief, the ability of music

165
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,699
to save us, or even a woman whose senses are
scrambled.

166
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:20,629
Anchored by one of the great performances
of the end of the 20th century, this film

167
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:26,220
uses camera, lighting, and sound to tell a
difficult story with compassion and resonance.

168
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,960
Next time, we’ll trade Paris for Mongolia
to witness a real teenage girl’s attempt

169
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,980
to master an ancient tradition and bear the
title Eagle Huntress.

170
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:38,050
